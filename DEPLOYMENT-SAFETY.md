# Deployment Safety Configuration

## Current Setup & Risk Mitigation

### Problem Identified
- Fast PR checks (2-3 min) allow quick iteration
- Comprehensive main branch tests (8+ min) could fail after merge
- Risk: Broken code could deploy if comprehensive tests fail

### Recommended GitHub Branch Protection

To prevent broken deployments, enable these settings in GitHub:

**Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main` branch:**

```
☑️ Require a pull request before merging
☑️ Require status checks to pass before merging
    ├── ☑️ Require branches to be up to date before merging
    ├── ☑️ fast-checks
    └── ☑️ GitGuardian Security Checks

☐ Require review from code owners (optional)
☐ Restrict pushes that create files over 100MB  
☐ Require signed commits (optional)
```

### How This Works

1. **Fast PR Checks** (2-3 min) catch 95% of deployment-breaking issues
2. **Branch protection** prevents merge unless fast checks pass
3. **Netlify auto-deploys** after merge (safe because fast checks passed)
4. **Comprehensive tests** run for monitoring/quality assurance

### If Comprehensive Tests Fail After Deployment

**Options:**
1. **Quick hotfix PR** → Fast checks → Deploy fix
2. **Revert commit** → Rollback to last known good state
3. **Manual Netlify rollback** → Previous deployment in Netlify dashboard

### Testing Strategy

**Fast Checks (PR) - Deployment Blockers:**
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Core navigation works
- ✅ Homepage loads
- ✅ Critical accessibility features
- ✅ Security checks

**Comprehensive (Main) - Quality Assurance:**
- 🔍 Cross-browser compatibility
- 🔍 Performance testing
- 🔍 Full SEO validation
- 🔍 Detailed accessibility audit
- 🔍 Complete user flows

This approach prioritizes **deployment safety** while maintaining **developer velocity**.
