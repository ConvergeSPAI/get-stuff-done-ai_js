    "content": " <p>I've been a little hesitant to post this and may end up deleting it, but there's an uncomfortable truth that CEOs need to hear in re AI...</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this technology stoke a sort of status anxiety in particular types of people, many of whom with roles at or near the c-level, and that may be blinding you to the urgent nature of what it implies.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not going to sugar-coat this: a lot of these folks are justifiably anxious (though, with a bit of a mindset shift, they don't necessarily have to be—every single person, regardless of their role, stands to benefit if they cultivate some curiosity, humility, and relentless focus on elevating the customer's good); the indisputable existence of cheap \"word-crunching machines\" threaten the positions of lawyers, engineers, marketers, financiers, product managers, et al and the various managerial roles at different levels of corporate aggregation.</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed being a bottleneck in some critical knowledge work process that involved processing and producing lots of unstructured data and were taking a slice of the capital that flowed through it (whether in management fees, a fat paycheck, or whatever other form) without having to also regularly retool, you are likely to have a very nasty wake up call in the next 2–5 years when that money spigot gets turned off or redirected toward a lean team that moves 10x as fast with 1/10th the overhead and team size and eats your lunch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highly regulated industries <em>are not safe</em>. PE portcos with privileged access to capital <em>are not safe</em>. Tech companies per se <em>are not safe</em>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>BUT—your fate is not sealed, and outsized upside is within your grasp...</p>\n\n<p>There is, however, one consistent limiting factor that I've seen that prevents CEOs from really appreciating the magnitude of the challenge and then empowering their employees to overcome it through bottoms-up experimentation (which is absolutely critical in the context of a new general purpose technology, which generate AI is):</p>\n\n<p><strong>Centralized IT.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is certainly not true of all enterprise IT leaders or organizations—but I have seen it enough that there's a meaningful trend: IT leadership (and, by extension, the various \"controllers\" across sec, legal, and procurement) may not want to give up power and control of technology vendor purchasing decisions, of implementation and adoption, of in-house development; but, if you want to bring your organization into the 21st century, you will need to wrest it from their hands and give it to the people who are closest to the customer and the problems they face.</p>\n\n<p>Tools like Claude Code are making it possible for frontline workers with direct access to \"sticky information\" to encode salient information into customer software. This will mean some people build their own home-grown solutions and others will want to purchase this new product category of hyper-specialized niche tooling from external vendors.</p>\n\n<p>If they cannot do this themselves, and FAST, the feedback loop will be too long for the org to learn, and that approval bottleneck will ultimate kill any chance you have of making it to the other side of this transformation.</p>\n\n<p>So, practically, if there were one thing I'd recommend doing to diagnose and start addressing this issue, it would be to measure exactly how long it takes for an employee who wants to use a new piece of tech to apply it to the problem at hand.</p>\n\n<p>If it is more than a day, then you are in the danger zone; I say this knowing that for many orgs, this is days, if not months (in certain parts of the public sector, even years).</p>\n\n<p>Figure out what would have to be true to reduce that cycle time by 10x. And then by another 10x. And so on. Don't be satisfied until you've prudently decentralized IT; there may be kicking and screaming and gnashing of teeth, but you will be better off for it (and, for the folks on those teams who see the AI light along the way, so will they).</p> ",

That's where the real magic happens.</p>\n<p>Here's why: When you only focus on optimization, you're playing within your existing boundaries. You're making your current box more efficient.</p>\n<p>But AI doesn't just optimize your box. It explodes the walls.</p>\n<p>Consider these examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A recently promoted manager using team meeting transcripts to identify right person on his or her team to backfill their prior role (not just track performance)</li>\n<li>A Chief Revenue Officer discovering customer needs they never knew existed through conversation analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A product team finding entirely new market segments by analyzing support tickets from a rabid, surprising user niche (e.g., paying close attention to these kinds of details is what allowed the founders of Justin dot tv to turn their company into Twitch, which was subsequently acquired by Amazon for over a billion dollars).</p>\n<p>The companies winning with AI aren't asking \"How can we cut costs?</p>\n<p>They're asking \"What couldn't we do before that we can do now?</p>\n<p>This requires a fundamental shift in thinking. It's about maniacally prioritizing the good of your customers—and then using AI as a \"macroscope\" to analyze the digital exhaust you generate at every touchpoint and discover surprising new ways to create value for them.</p>\n<p>Your competitors are racing to cut 20% of their costs.</p>\n<p>You could be discovering 200% more ways to serve your market.</p>\n<p>Which game do you want to play?</p>\n<p>What new capabilities has AI unlocked in your business that you couldn't have imagined two years ago?</p>\n<p>h/t Ben for a good chat this am in re this and more...</p>\n",

    "date": "2025-05-20",
    "content": " <p>We stand at the cusp of a new form of value creation, one born from the digital exhaust of our collaborations with agentic AI. The true gold isn't just the final code or content these systems help us produce; it's the&nbsp;process&nbsp;itself – the intricate, timestamped dance of prompts, interim outputs, corrections, and verifications.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a system meticulously logging every interaction with your AI coding assistant (like Claude Code, or any emerging agentic product). Each query, each suggestion, each generated snippet, each successful compile, and ultimately, each \"PR approved\" or \"payment received\" – this isn't just a chat log. It's a high-fidelity record of&nbsp;new tacit knowledge being forged in real-time.</p>\n\n<p>This is the knowledge that arises when tackling problems just outside the current scope of the AI's pre-training data. These unbroken sequences of interactions, culminating in a validated, successful outcome, are the raw, invaluable feedstock for Reinforcement Learning (RL).</p>\n\n<p>And&nbsp;RL-trained, distilled small models? They represent perhaps the densest, most potent form of a company's unique intellectual property. This is how you build the machine that generates&nbsp;proprietary data, allowing you to \"hillclimb\" with In-Context Learning (ICL) through your product experience. You gather enough unique, validated interaction data that you can then distill what&nbsp;works&nbsp;into a lean, specialized, fine-tuned model. This model&nbsp;is&nbsp;the product,&nbsp;is&nbsp;the moat, conferring a significant cost and performance advantage, enabling you to monopolize your niche.</p>\n\n<p>The current platforms don't quite grasp this. GitHub is for Technē – the artifact, the codified output. YouTube might capture a demonstration. But what we need is a way to capture, index, and even selectively open-source&nbsp;Métis&nbsp;– the practical, cunning intelligence, the&nbsp;how-to&nbsp;embedded in the journey of creation. We need a repository for the digital exhaust generated&nbsp;during&nbsp;the encoding of Technē.</p>\n\n<p>This begins with LLM chat logs, yes, but it rapidly expands as these systems become multimodal. We're on the verge of seeing new \"multiplayer mode\" AI-native alternatives to the 20th-century corporation, where this shared, evolving, interaction-driven knowledge base is the central nervous system.</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate exit strategy here isn't just a product; it's selling this entire data-generating and model-distilling engine to a foundational model provider like OpenAI. You’ve essentially created a specialized data factory and a proven method for \"king of the (latent space) hill\" in your domain.</p>\n\n<p>This entire endeavor, however, hinges on a brutally pragmatic foundation:&nbsp;survival and validation through real-world utility.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to AI benchmarks, the only evaluation that truly matters is:&nbsp;<strong>Did you get paid?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This necessitates a radical shift in development philosophy for early-stage ventures, especially as the cost of capital climbs while the fixed costs of basic software deployment plummet:</p><ul><li><p>You should be&nbsp;coding on prod.</p></li><li><p>No branching. No staging environment. No custom domain. Not until you are generating free cash flow.</p></li><li><p>So much pain is avoided, and the odds of success dramatically increased, if you can find&nbsp;one customer&nbsp;– just one – willing to cover your entire marginal and fixed costs. Only then should you even&nbsp;think&nbsp;about scaling.</p></li><li><p>Your time is infinitely better spent unearthing and intimately serving a single person's (or entity's) latent needs than prematurely worrying about \"internet-scale\" architecture.</p></li><li><p>Monolith-maxxing is the way.</p></li><li><p>No classes. No functions. No unit tests, in the traditional sense.</p></li><li><p>Not a single refactor until positive free cash flow is a reality.</p></li></ul><p>This isn't about cowboy coding; it's about ruthless prioritization. The \"test\" in this new form of test-driven development isn't a suite of automated checks; it's the affirmative answer to the question:&nbsp;\"Is anyone going to pay you for this?</p>\n\n<p>Every interaction, every line of code under this regime, is directly tied to solving a paying customer's problem. And it's precisely these high-stakes, commercially validated interactions that become the most valuable data for training the next iteration of your proprietary, value-creating AI.</p>\n\n<p>This is the loop: real problems, AI-assisted solutions, captured interaction data, validated by payment, distilled into superior models, leading to market dominance. The alchemy of the 21st century.</p> ",

    "content": "<p>How should you think about scaling business systems in 2025?</p>\n<p>It's a good question, and this is something that's been top of mind for me recently. Although a lot of business fundamentals remain the same, I do have a lot of conviction that the way in which you design and implement these scalable systems changes quite a bit in the context of AI.</p>\n<p>Now that we have computers that can crunch words, it's probably good to question the necessity of the various types of bureaucratic scaffolding that were necessary to keep a company in sync. In practice, this means fewer meetings, more expectations in regard to working and collaborating asynchronously in an AI-mediated way where everybody shares data and outcome-oriented work. That's something that's always been critical for entrepreneurs but I think now will have to be more ubiquitous amongst white-collar workers in general since the rote and reliable can be increasingly delegated to machines.</p>\n<p>Having a cross-functional lean team get hyper-focused on an ambitious objective with recurring meetings to sync at the highest level and then on the product and growth sides respectively, coupled with a decentralized approach to IT and micro-services purchases, has seemed to work pretty well with me when I work with fractional professionals and contractors. We have a common goal, and everyone gets a capped company credit card that they can use to deploy a bit of working capital however they see fit. We use probability scores to increase our sales every week toward those pre-negotiated objectives. And bundling all this together catalyzed by AI seems to massively accelerate progress while keeping the teams extremely small and even completely fractional in some cases.</p>\n",

I live in a two-party consent state, and notetakers won't join phone calls (nor should they IMO), but it's legal for me to record what I say. I just throw in the AirPods and go for a walk. The Pendant captures my half of the conversation and I don't worry about taking notes esp in re whatever commitments I make.

They realize there's a significant amount of work they should delegate but lack the immediate resources.</p>\n<p>At this point, state-of-the-art AI reasoning models could step in.</p>\n<p>These models could handle the complex tasks of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scoping specific Requests for Proposals (RFPs).</li>\n<li>Structuring milestone-based payment schedules.</li>\n<li>Assessing options across various budget levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, with the user's sign-off, the system could seamlessly post these generated RFPs directly onto the Upwork platform. It could even facilitate putting funds into escrow, all within just a few taps.</p>\n<p>I have personally gone through this process manually multiple times, and each instance resulted in a positive experience. The core benefit here is that AI significantly decreases transaction costs – particularly the costs associated with search and negotiation. This is crucial because finding freelancers often requires creating custom contracts or terms for each project. (While monitoring project progress would still need separate attention, the initial setup becomes much more efficient.)</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Upwork appears to be a perfect fit for the trajectory of consumer and prosumer AI tools. If I were leading the company, I would be making a substantial strategic bet on this type of integration accordingly...</p>\n<p>What other data would you like to act on in 10x fewer clicks?</p>\n<p>Where are the transaction costs prohibitively high (but should be expected to fall)?</p>\n",

    "title": "Beyond the Dashboard: Unlocking Your D2C Growth with Customer Conversations (Scaled by AI)",
    "date": "2025-04-16",
    "content": " <p>You're a D2C founder or marketer. You're likely swimming in data – CTRs, CVRs, AOV, retention rates, social engagement metrics. You're probably using AI, or thinking hard about it, to analyze this data, generate content faster, maybe even optimize ad spend. You're busy, moving nimbly on a small team, feeling constantly \"in the weeds\" with tactical execution – creating tomorrow's ads today, managing social comments and urgent support requests, trying to find time for strategy amidst the chaos.</p>\n\n<p>The common AI playbook looks something like this:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Analyze:</strong>&nbsp;Use AI to sift through your existing quantitative data (website analytics, sales data, ad performance).</p></li><li><p><strong>Prioritize:</strong>&nbsp;Identify patterns, hopefully uncover some surprising insights, and decide where to focus your limited resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Act:</strong>&nbsp;Leverage AI to execute faster or better – drafting blog posts, generating ad creatives, maybe even optimizing landing pages; generative AI great for accelerating progress on all of these tasks!</p></li></ol><p>This loop is valuable. It helps turn data into action. But, it often relies&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;on the data you can easily instrument and collect through your existing systems (commerce platforms, marketing tools, product analytics).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem: Your Richest Data Isn't in Your Dashboard</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's a vast, incredibly valuable dataset that most dashboards miss entirely:&nbsp;<strong>the experiences, motivations, and goals living inside your customers' heads.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This \"human data\" includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The \"Why\" Behind the Buy:</strong>&nbsp;The actual, often messy, story of how they discovered you, the problem they were&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;trying to solve, the alternatives they considered, and the final trigger that led to purchase. This isn't captured in UTM parameters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unmet Needs & Deeper Desires:</strong>&nbsp;What goals are they&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;trying to achieve, related or unrelated to your product? Where does your product fall short, even if they like it? What would make them truly delighted or devastated if your product disappeared?</p></li><li><p><strong>Hidden Context & Channels:</strong>&nbsp;Where do they&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;talk about products like yours? A private WhatsApp group? A niche subreddit? A conversation with a friend? (I call these \"digital watering holes\"). Your analytics won't show you this.</p></li></ul><p>Without this qualitative insight, your AI analysis is working with an incomplete picture. Your prioritization might be logical based on the available numbers, but it could miss the kind of opportunities that unlock 10x growth. Your AI-generated content might be efficient, but lack the specific resonance that turns a prospect into a loyal fan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tapping into the Human Data Goldmine</strong></p>\n\n<p>How do you get this data? You have to talk to people. Specifically, your&nbsp;<em>customers</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Before diving into the black hole of specialized GAI tooling for marketers, the single most impactful thing you can do&nbsp;<em>right now</em>&nbsp;– even more than optimizing workflows or adopting new AI tools for tactical tasks – is to&nbsp;<strong>systematically interview your customers.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Effective qualitative interviews aren't just casual chats. They involve techniques like:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Storytelling Prompts:</strong>&nbsp;Ask customers to recount their journey. \"Tell me about the time before you found us...\" Listen for emotional cues (positive or negative surprises) – these often signal moments where you moved closer to or further from their goals. Dig in there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Counterfactual Questions:</strong>&nbsp;To understand deeper needs and future desires, ask \"what if\" questions. \"How upset would you be (0-5) if you couldn't use our product anymore?\" If they say \"3,\" follow up with, \"What would need to be true for it to be a '4' or '5'?\" This surfaces unmet needs and potential product/marketing directions.</p></li></ol><p>Initially, founders and core team members are often the best people to do these interviews. You have the deepest context about the business and can pick up on nuances. But, this obviously doesn't scale.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scaling Qualitative Insights with AI: The Vertical and Horizontal Boost</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is where AI, specifically conversational voice AI assistants like&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\">Vapi</a> (<a href=\"https://vapi.ai/blog/scaling-client-intake-engine-with-vapi-voice-ai-agents?utm_source=LinkedIN&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=Christian_1April_LI_Post\" target=\"_blank\">which I'm a big fan of</a>), becomes a powerful&nbsp;<em>complement</em>&nbsp;to human interviews, allowing you to scale this crucial data gathering both vertically and horizontally:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Vertical Scaling (Deeper Live Calls):</strong>&nbsp;Use a voice assistant to conduct a brief, automated pre-interview before your scheduled live call. It can gather baseline information, context, or even initial answers to key questions. This \"front-loads\" the conversation, meaning your precious live time is spent diving deep into the most insightful areas, making you far more prepared and likely to uncover breakthroughs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Horizontal Scaling (Broader Reach):</strong>&nbsp;You can't personally interview hundreds of customers, especially early on. But you&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;offer an incentive (like a gift card or discount) for customers to have a 10-15 minute structured conversation with your AI voice assistant on their own time. It costs a fraction of a founder's time, feels more personal and engaging than a survey link, and gathers significantly richer data than a standard form. This allows you to complement, say, 10 deep human interviews with insights from 90+ customers via AI.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Closing the Loop: Smarter AI Fueled by Deeper Human Insight</strong></p>\n\n<p>Imagine having transcripts and summaries from 100 customer conversations – a mix of deep human interviews and scaled AI interactions.&nbsp;<em>Now</em>&nbsp;feed&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;into your AI analysis tools (like Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT).</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, the AI isn't just analyzing clickstream data; it's analyzing customer stories, pain points, goals, and verbatim language — that's valuable data that's <em>yours</em>: no other market intermediary (Amazon or anyone else) has access to, and it contains nuggets of insight that can help you move faster in the right direction, toward rapid, healthy growth.</p>\n\n<p>The insights generated will be richer. Your prioritization will be sharper, focused on what&nbsp;<em>truly</em>&nbsp;matters to your best customers. And your subsequent AI-powered actions – the content you create, the landing pages you test, the ad angles you try – will be grounded in genuine customer understanding, making them far more likely to resonate and drive results like higher CTR and CVR.</p>\n\n<p>You'll know&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;your happiest customers are,&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;they love you, and&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;to find more people like them. You'll uncover surprising opportunities and gain clarity on what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to do. You'll have a wealth of raw material (testimonials, specific language) to repurpose directly into your marketing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your Next Step</strong></p>\n\n<p>Don't wait for the \"perfect\" sample size. Identify your outliers – highest AOV, best retention, public evangelists on social media, even those with interesting negative feedback. If you don't have clear \"lovers\" yet (like the D2C company whose product needs time to show results), use counterfactuals on a broader sample to find the gaps.</p>\n\n<p>Commit to gathering qualitative data. Schedule those first few human interviews. Explore using a tool like Vapi to scale your reach efficiently. Collect the stories.</p>\n\n<p>Then, let AI help you analyze that rich tapestry of human experience. The combination is where the magic happens, moving you from being reactive and \"in the weeds\" to being proactive, strategic, and deeply connected to the customers driving your growth.</p><hr><p>Want help uncovering the opportunities hidden in your customer insights and designing your AI execution roadmap?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://calendly.com/d/cst9-jzy-7kj/accelerated-ai-adoption-strategic-planning-call\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sign up for a free 15-minute Strategic Planning Call to identify your immediate next steps.</strong></a></p> ",

    "date": "2025-04-14",
    "content": "<p>Something I've started to do recently, in part because I'm dictating all the time anyway, but also because of my new Limitless pendant, is to very clearly articulate acceptance criteria for every single task on my to-do list before I actually start doing anything.</p>\n<p>I've noticed that doing that, and then even mumbling under my breath what it is I'm doing or my own kind of thought process as I'm going along, is quite helpful for keeping me focused. It also reminds me what the objective actually is, instead of getting lost in the details.</p>\n<p>Quick example: I had on my to-do list to send a prep email to a new client for a session where we're going to negotiate the right outcome for an upcoming workshop.</p>\n<p>I sort of took a step back and thought to myself, \"What is the actual desired outcome here?</p>\n<p>It is that we've negotiated the desired outcome, sort of at the exclusion of other possible applications of AI or other workflows that we could focus on and maybe tackle subsequently. And the client is super excited and committed to it, and there's clarity about what they need to bring in terms of data. I've also made a series of recommendations in terms of tooling that they should bring.</p>\n<p>I kind of derived from that, just implicitly, that because this was their first time doing this, they probably could benefit from a bit of guidance regarding how this sort of session goes. So I realized that instead of just reminding them, \"This is what we're trying to get to\" or whatever, it would probably be quite helpful for them to even see three compressed and de-identified summaries or micro-cases from three client engagements I had across different industries, even since we had our last call.</p>\n<p>I went ahead and retrieved those from Fireflies and worked with Google's AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to work it into an email draft. Again, I thought to myself, \"If I were in their shoes, would this be likely to help them get to that negotiated outcome for the workshop faster?\" I even asked Gemini if it would, iterated a couple of times, and then fired it off.</p>\n<p>I suspect that if you cultivate this discipline or habit, even when going through a to-do list or pre-existing commitments, of always returning back to the desired outcome as the anchor point for your intention for the duration of the task—as opposed to simply focusing on the production of the output—those little adjustments that you make during the course of your work probably compound into something better.</p>\n<p>I already know this because I facilitate a lot of OKR cycles with start-ups and executive teams, and prioritizing outcomes over outputs, and high-quality inputs over income per se, is core to making this kind of thing work. I suspect that it's generally true, especially when operating under conditions of uncertainty and doing lots of context switching. And in practice, it seems to be useful for knocking out to-dos.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, it is buttressed by voice-driven use of AI in the course of getting stuff done.</p>\n",

I then feed these recordings into AI to create useful outputs.</p>\n<p>For example, drafting Upwork RFPs with milestones, product requirement documents for tools like <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> or Replit to build from, or even website marketing content via Lovable.</p>\n<p>This lets me be productive on the go, and walking seems to stimulate better ideas.</p>\n<p>As AI models improve (with tool calling, multimodal I/O, better turn detection) and sensors like the Limitless Pendant become common, walking and talking with an AI assistant could become more productive than desk work.</p>\n<p>The main limit now is model intelligence; we're likely two model generations away from this replacing focused laptop work, but it's moving that way incrementally.</p>\n<p>Here’s a concrete example that will improve as tools like <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> (and SaaS vendors that house your digital exhaust) better support MCP connectors:</p>\n<p>I have a product at 10 customers needing work beyond my scope to reach 100. To get there I'm meeting potential partners next week who can take on some technical work outside my expertise and interest. To prepare, I need a succinct onboarding one-pager plus addendum detailing customer feedback, code nuances, and architecture.</p>\n<p>I can dictate the core one-pager in 30 minutes as previously discussed; but, I also need info from ~20 customer calls (in Fireflies.ai) and the GitHub repo included. Currently, retrieving this requires manual desktop work (using Raycast  scripts / @RepoPrompt helps but isn't seamless). Feeding this context into Google's new Gemini 2.5 Pro model— which is really fantastic and seems to have come out of nowhere—gets me about 85% of a detailed, high-information content draft that moves me much closer to my desired outcome of qualifying and potentially onboarding these partners.</p>\n<p>Ideally, a voice agent triggered by my Limitless Pendant could passively capture my needs, automatically retrieve the Fireflies data and code via MCP, create the draft (G Doc is fine), and prompt me for review on my iPhone minutes later.</p>\n<p>You can quickly imagine the unprecedented level of productivity this kind of setup could afford a one-person operation with a growing data asset. Growing your business with your voice was previously only accessible to billionaires making phone calls on yachts off the Amalfi coast to competent lieutenants. Suddenly, we'll all be afforded—if we so choose—similar capabilities.</p>\n<p>Standing desks are great; walking for 10 miles a day while you GSD via your superintelligent, voice-driven AI assistant is even better, and we'd probably all be both healthier (and a few pounds lighter) and find ourselves engaged in more profitable projects.</p>\n",

    "content": " <blockquote><p>[The following article was derived from an unstructured monologue that was automatically recorded from my new <a target=\"_blank\">Limitless</a> </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_i-was-an-early-and-very-happy-limitless-activity-7315093051696111618-hK7N?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAVulxsBFyr0EzPHwXppryACSci3VX4WxgQ\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pendant</em></a><em> while I was getting the kids ready for the day (no AirPods, no phone). I just spoke loud and then popped it into both ChatGPT's o1 Pro model and Gemini 2.5 Pro, iterating back and forth asking them to critique each other's drafts until I had something I was happy with (at least enough to spend another 10 minutes putting finishing touches on tagging vendors etc.). I'll continue to do more of these experiments with nascent ambient compute and share the results on LinkedIn.]</p></blockquote><hr><p>Something I need to get done today: <em>creating a targeted growth campaign for AI services in the legal sector</em>—especially for smaller law firms. As I talked through the steps, I realized it’s a perfect example of where we are now with AI tools, where we could be soon, and what it might look like when everything is frictionless in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Current Reality: So Many Steps, So Many Clicks</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’m juggling a handful of AI and automation tools—everything from email-sending assistants (via <a target=\"_blank\">Shortwave | We're Hiring!</a>) to semi-automated product development pipelines (e.g., <a target=\"_blank\">Fireflies.ai</a> transcripts captured from customer discovery interview -> Claude Code).</p>\n\n<p>Right now (esp. in the context of the new campaign I want to launch), if I want to craft a new landing page or do in-depth research, I have to:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Retrieve transcripts</strong> from my meeting recordings (I store these in Fireflies, among other places).</p></li><li><p><strong>Search</strong> across multiple accounts, tabs, or scripts to gather the insights I need.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spin up code</strong> (local React app dev via CC and <a target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> or via a cloud dev environment / \"vibe coding\" product like <a target=\"_blank\">Lovable</a>) to update my site and deploy with Netlify.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create</strong> email drip campaigns, SMS blasts, scheduling workflows, and voice-driven intake and qualification with a suite of marketing tools: e.g., <a target=\"_blank\">Calendly</a>, <a target=\"_blank\">HubSpot</a>, <a target=\"_blank\">Vapi</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Research</strong> top-of-funnel targets and find relevant podcasts or communities (ChatGPT / Gemini Deep Research -> analysis of past transcripts by pulling from the <a target=\"_blank\">Listen Notes, Inc.</a> API to ensure I can contribute to their platform and not repeat whatever past guests have said) to pitch directly or via a broker like <a target=\"_blank\">PodMatch</a> .</p></li><li><p><strong>Manually integrate</strong> everything back into a coherent and cohesive funnel—landing pages, sign-up forms, analytics, you name it.</p></li></ul><p>It all works. But it’s a lot of friction and definitely not the super-smooth, “AI-does-it-all” dream we keep hearing about.</p><hr><p><strong>Why Law Firms?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’ve already helped several law firms—from criminal defense and personal injury <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_thanks-luke-ls-carlson-law-pc-activity-7310781753038680065-_oYI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAVulxsBFyr0EzPHwXppryACSci3VX4WxgQ\" target=\"_blank\">to HOA specialists</a>—use AI in their operations. Each of those engagements generated a ton of potentially valuable data: transcripts, meeting recordings, tool configurations, results, and so on. This vast collection of interaction data—<strong>our “digital exhaust”</strong>—becomes the essential raw material that future AI agents will mine for context, personalization, and proactive insights. Having a track record with four (soon to be more) law firm clients means there’s enough credibility and “compelling facts” to do a real campaign.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why focus on AI for lawyers?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Many are looking for an edge—efficiency, speed, better client service as AI drives down the cost of reading, writing, and reasoning tasks.</p></li><li><p>It’s a conservative industry, so showcasing real-world success stories matters.</p></li><li><p>There’s a massive opportunity to automate tasks like drafting hyper-personalized demand letters, summarizing depositions, and even reviewing evidence with a fine-tooth comb + suggesting cross-examination questions.</p></li></ul><hr><p><strong>The Campaign Strategy</strong></p>\n\n<p>I want to create a hyper-targeted campaign that might include:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>Landing Page</strong> specifically for law firms interested in AI, with copy and content derived from the good work I've already done.</p></li><li><p>A signup form for a <strong>Webinar</strong> or “live AI magic show” that demonstrates these tools in action (60–90 minutes, Q&A, etc.); I do these all the time.</p></li><li><p>An <strong>Email Drip</strong> or SMS follow-up sequence (probably in HubSpot, though I may check other platforms).</p></li><li><p><strong>Podcast Outreach</strong> to appear on niche lawyer-focused shows (via Podmatch or direct outreach) for top-of-top-of-funnel.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Deep Research Reports</strong> (e.g., “What personal-injury firms in New Mexico are doing with AI right now,” \"what precedent has been set in Rhode Island for AI use in DUI discovery\") as lead magnets to attract interest and market the webinar via a complementary drip campaign.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Do All This?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Thought Leadership</strong>: Doing it live, showcasing real client wins, and clarifying exactly how AI can transform a law firm’s practice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: A big webinar means I can teach multiple firms at once, saving me from repeating the same demos.</p></li><li><p><strong>SEO & Content</strong>: Blog posts, FAQ pages for lawyers, and in-depth tool comparisons help attract inbound interest and \"capitalize\" on my unique data asset, which grows with every client engagement.</p></li></ul><hr><p><strong>The Friction: Where AI Falls Short (for Now)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite having good AI tools, I still have to do a lot of manual orchestration. For example, if I want a transcript-based report on “podcasts that suit my AI-for-lawyers angle,” I’ll:</p><ol><li><p>Pull transcripts from open Chrome tabs <a href=\"https://github.com/culstrup/fireflies-raycast\" target=\"_blank\">via the open-source</a> <a target=\"_blank\">Raycast</a> script I wrote.</p></li><li><p>Feed that into a reasoning model + Deep Research to scour the internet for salient, niche podcasts.</p></li><li><p>Review the summarized results and decide which three to five podcasts to target.</p></li><li><p>Craft a pitch</p></li><li><p>Double-check everything (and probably at every incremental step) for accuracy.</p></li></ol><p>This is still “the future,” but it involves more busywork than I’d like; it can all be accomplished in 1–2 deep work sessions, but there is a <em>ton</em> of clicking and context switching, which can be draining. In my ideal world, my wearable AI (like my Limitless Pendant that’s always listening, at least by default) would just <strong>parse my morning monologue, spin up an agent, and handle these steps invisibly</strong>—only pausing to confirm details or alert me when a big decision or next-level budget is required; my intent is clear enough that the system can take things as far as it's able to before it hits an expensive pocket of uncertainty that demands my own \"executive\" attention.</p><hr><p><strong>A Vision of “Ambient” AI</strong></p>\n\n<p>Imagine hooking up multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers or other orchestrator systems (Google's <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/\" target=\"_blank\">new A2A Protocol</a> might be an interesting complement) that let different specialized agents collaborate:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Agent 0</strong> (powered by the smartest, most expensive model) comes up with a plan</p></li><li><p><strong>Agent 1</strong> retrieves meeting transcripts automatically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Agent 2</strong> handles website and landing-page updates ( <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/cognition-ai-labs/\">Cognition</a> 's Devon?)</p></li><li><p><strong>Agent 3</strong> scans Podmatch and other directories for relevant podcasts, crafts an intro email or pitch, and queues it for my review.</p></li><li><p><strong>Agent 4</strong> sets up the webinar funnel, integrates analytics (Google Tag Manager, etc.), and schedules test runs.</p></li></ul><p>Everything happens behind the scenes. The AI pin just listens to me brainstorming, identifies tasks, and delegates to specialized agents. Crucially, these systems wouldn’t just reactively execute commands; they would <strong>proactively bootstrap</strong> new opportunities (and formalize goals or acceptance criteria that drive the activities of all of the other agents <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASXjCW3Ut2o\" target=\"_blank\">à la a disciplined OKR process</a>), draft initial plans, or suggest strategies by continuously analyzing patterns and latent needs within our digital exhaust. </p>\n\n<p>When done well, this would feel like having a top-tier enterprise department on standby 24/7, all triggered by a casual voice note—or even working proactively to accelerate progress toward your quarterly objective, all driven by the proprietary, salient, high-fidelity digital exhaust you (and your collaborators) generate daily.</p><hr><p><strong>The Long Game: Everyone Gets a Mini Corporation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I see a world where each person (or small business) has a “swarm” of AI agents acting like an invisible workforce—<strong>orchestrating tasks, collecting data, and running experiments</strong>. You feed it the bigger goals—like “Expand my AI consulting into 10 new law firms”—and the system works out how to get there: from budgeting to scheduling to copywriting w/ limited tugging on your scarce attention.</p>\n\n<p>We’re not fully there yet (and not even close). But by capturing not just the product of your expert/entrepreneurial labor, but also the <em>process</em><strong><em>, at least latently in timestamped, thoughtfully indexed primary sources generated through nascent ambient computing sensors</em></strong>—every meeting, every transcript, every piece of feedback—you can build the data foundation that tomorrow’s agent swarms will need to help you GSD 10x faster.</p><hr><p><strong>Conclusion: It’s Here, But It’s Not</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, that’s where my head is right now: pushing forward on a lawyer-focused AI campaign while juggling a bunch of separate tools. It works, but it’s not seamless. Give it five, ten, or maybe fifteen years, and I suspect we’ll look back on all these clicks and manual steps the same way we look at dial-up internet today.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, if you’re eyeing the AI frontier—especially in a niche industry—my advice is simple:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Capture Everything</strong> – Transcripts, steps, successes, fails. This data, your digital exhaust, will feed future automations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Define Specific Goals</strong> – Pick a niche (like small law firms) and go deep (deeper than anyone else ever has or could, which is increasingly feasible as the cost of machine intelligence continues to fall like a rock) with a clear offering, derived from your initial, successful, manual attempts at solving new problems in new ways.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use AI Where It Shines</strong> – Summaries, outlines, quick code fixes—and then manually fine-tune the last mile.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stay Nimble</strong> – The next big shift in AI could be tomorrow. Remain ready to pivot, and don't get overly attached / over-engineer your current processes & AI tech stack.</p></li></ol><p>We can see how powerful it’ll be when these friction points are smoothed out. For now, though, I’m embracing the scrappiness—clicks, scripts, and the occasional under-the-bed toddler rescue (which apparently was woven into the original transcript for this piece)—and forging ahead.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://gsdat.work\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about how you can start integrating AI into your core operations and set yourself for long-term success with expert support.</a></p> ",

I captured about 80% of it, popped it into Gemini 2.5 Pro via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/\">Google</a> 's AI Studio, and was pretty happy with the results!</p>\n\n<p>See for yourself [full output from Gemini 2.5, based purely on the raw transcript of our discussion, below]:</p><hr><blockquote><p>Okay, based on your conversation, here are the key insights distilled for thinking about enterprise sales, especially from a \"team of one\" perspective:</p></blockquote><p><strong>Focus Intensely on the Individual Buyer, Not the Company</strong>: Companies don't buy; <em>people</em> do. Forget abstract company names initially and deeply research the specific individuals you want to engage with. Understand their role, their context within the organization, and what drives them personally and professionally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deep Prep is Non-Negotiable (10x-100x More)</strong>: Especially when lacking a large sales engine, your leverage comes from preparation. Before any significant interaction, thoroughly research the individual's \"digital exhaust\" (public statements, articles, interviews, etc.). Sketch out hypotheses about their formal/informal goals, challenges, and context. This level of prep is likely far more intensive than you might initially think.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Understand the Buyer's Full Context & Goals</strong>: Go beyond the surface. Figure out their formal goals (OKRs, KPIs) but also their informal/latent goals and anxieties. What keeps them up at night? What would make themlook successful? Your job is to connect your offering to their success and relieve <em>their</em> anxiety.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prioritize Warm Connections, Use Cold Outreach Surgically</strong>: Warm introductions are vastly more effective (\"100% of the time\"). Standard cold outbound is expensive and low-yield for a solo operator. The <em>only</em> time cold outreach might work is if it's hyper-personalized, based on a genuinely compelling insight derived from your deep research into that <em>specific</em> person (e.g., reacting insightfully to something specific they said in a podcast). Generic outreach is ignored.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Frame Value as Increased Confidence & Reduced Anxiety</strong>: People often feel overwhelmed or uncertain about hitting their goals. Position your offering as something that, in exchange for resources (money, time), will significantly increase their <em>confidence</em> in achieving a specific, important goal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Discovery to Uncover Real Needs (Magic Wand Question)</strong>: Don't just accept the initial problem statement. Probe deeper. Ask questions like, \"If you could wave a magic wand and get a single result in three months, what would it be?\" Take a <em>full inventory</em> of their challenges before proposing solutions. Your expertise lies in identifying where you can make the most impact quickly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Build Trust Actively</strong>: Trust is crucial, especially in low-trust environments. Consciously demonstrate the four pillars:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Credibility</strong>: Show you know what you're talking about.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Do what you say you'll do.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intimacy</strong>: Be willing to be appropriately vulnerable or take small personal risks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low Self-Orientation</strong>: Genuinely focus on their needs, not just your sale.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Use Industry Stats Sparingly and Strategically</strong>: Stats are mainly useful for initial prospecting (where to look) or sometimes to make someone feel they're <em>lagging behind </em>peers (use with caution). Always validate if the stat actually matters to the specific person's concerns; otherwise, it's irrelevant noise. Don't lead with generic stats.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Target Thoughtful Risk-Takers</strong>: Individuals who put thoughtful, non-generic ideas out publicly are often more willing to engage with new approaches and take calculated risks – potentially better targets for innovative solutions. Avoid those who only publish generic \"consultant speak.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, as a team of one, your superpower is <em>deep empathy and insight</em> derived from meticulous preparation, allowing you to bypass generic approaches and connect directly with the specific needs and anxieties of <em>individual buyers</em>, no matter the scale of the organization.</p> ",

    "content": "<p>Steal my books to train your AI?!</p>\n<p>I get why authors like Ann Handley are outraged.</p>\n<p>But, is there a bigger opportunity hidden in all this IP chaos?</p>\n<p>Recently, Ann shared how Meta “looted” millions of books (including her own) to train Llama 3 (link in comments). No consent, no compensation, no credit. It’s a valid gut punch to any author or creator who’s poured it all into their words—with reasonable expectations of remuneration!</p>\n<p>But, in a conversation I just had with a mentor of mine (h/t Mark), we went one step further: Are we reaching a point where “knowledge” is not only free…but instantly applicable by AI models? It’s one thing to let a machine index your writing. It’s another when it can apply your frameworks, mimic your voice, and solve real problems—no human (or author) in the loop, no speaking fees, no consulting projects, no licensing deals.</p>\n<p>So if we assume AI has already bulldozed the old rules…how can authors, experts, and creators adapt?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leverage “early credit.”</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>If you know your content will be vacuumed into corporate AI models (and then open source soon after), consider seeding key insights proactively (on your own terms). The big question is: how do we show up as the recognized “source” or authority once it’s baked into the model?</li>\n<li>My hunch: Over time, these models—and the humans using them—will track who had the novel insights first. Being “early” garners credibility and can bring unexpected inbound attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Go beyond the “book” model.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Authors used to package IP in a single product (like Ann’s awesome books), then count on monetizing knowledge via sales or speaking engagements. But there’s a new angle: building private “data assets” or knowledge bases that only your agent can query—turning your IP into a service (think: “machine‐to‐machine” transactions) instead of a one‐time download.</li>\n<li>Yes, this might sound sci‐fi, but with usage‐based APIs, you could let other people’s AI “ask” your protected agent for insights—paying you in real time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>View everything as an experiment.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When you do “real work” for clients or on your own projects, record and timestamp your best insights, case studies, frameworks—everything. The cost of building your own “IP pipeline” is lower than ever. Down the road, you can license that to a publisher or cut a direct deal with an AI lab.</li>\n<li>It’s not guaranteed money, but the new “going public” might be shipping your specialized database or GitHub repo to the highest bidder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m not defending Meta’s approach here—at all. We should absolutely challenge tech companies that bypass legitimate licensing channels. But new technology tends to reshape IP (and the means by which its commercialized) whether we like it or not. The question is less “how do we stop it?” and more “how do we position ourselves to thrive?”</p>\n<p>Curious what others think—especially Ann!</p>\n<p>Does this bigger AI wave open doors for creators, or just leave us with stolen work, uncredited, in a giant corporate model?</p>\n",

    "date": "2025-03-08",
    "content": "<p>Is “vibe coding” really a bad idea, or is it just misunderstood?</p>\n<p>As creating software from scratch becomes increasingly accessible to professionals without traditional computer science backgrounds, I’ve noticed a rising wave of criticism from some corners of the development community. Terms like “vibe coding” get thrown around dismissively, with claims that such approaches are sloppy, misguided, or inevitably lead to more trouble than they’re worth.</p>\n<p>But here’s what often gets missed in that critique: “vibe coding” only falls short when you skip the critical step of reflection and deep understanding.</p>\n<p>There’s a growing trend of professionals jumping into software development, starting with no-code tools like Zapier and advancing to platforms like Replit or sophisticated AI agents like <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Code (Anthropic’s brand-new coding agent currently available in a research preview via terminal—and frankly, one of the most powerful AI tools available right now). Often, people get stuck after building initial versions because the next steps become unclear or overwhelming.</p>\n<p>The key insight here is that no matter how powerful these tools become, genuine understanding remains essential.</p>\n<p>This week, I spent a few hours using <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Code to build a project in TypeScript—my first significant effort with this language. My inputs were minimal: a transcript from a client call, some external API documentation, and my judgment. Iteratively guiding <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Code through verbal prompts, I eventually reached a working solution.</p>\n<p>But I didn’t stop there. The most valuable part came afterward: a deliberate 90-minute debrief session, going line-by-line to ensure I genuinely understood the system I’d built. I wasn’t afraid to ask seemingly “dumb” questions (“How does NPM actually work?”) until the black box became transparent.</p>\n<p>Previously, I’ve effectively learned by generating code with <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a>, then manually integrating it piece-by-piece, forcing hands-on engagement to grasp the underlying mechanics.</p>\n<p>When working at high levels of abstraction, there’s always a risk of building something you don’t fully understand. This can quickly spiral into confusing spaghetti code, creating immediate headaches or long-term issues.</p>\n<p>The solution? Be disciplined about regularly reflecting alongside your AI assistant. Aim for “100% conceptual coverage”—clearly understanding every piece of your system at a conceptual level. This discipline prevents costly pitfalls and empowers sustainable growth as a builder.</p>\n<p>Remember: Good software, like good management, requires both the 30,000-foot vision and the 3-foot detail.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>AI is ultimately a social technology, and there's room for innovation management per se as more agents come online:</p>\n<p>The question of what to do while an agent like <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Code or Deep Research is running is an interesting one. Currently, these agents exist in a liminal space between real-time feedback—where you want to stay closely engaged—and full delegation. At the extreme end of delegation, you’d typically give a highly competent employee context about a high-level problem or desired outcome, checking in perhaps once a week.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Code currently operates in increments of roughly 3 to 10 minutes. Due to the complexity of its tasks, completely disengaging or context-switching risks losing the thread, making it difficult to provide effective direction. Yesterday, I encountered exactly this issue while managing two development projects simultaneously, alongside client-facing tasks. Although I made substantial progress, the context-switching imposed a significant cognitive load, leaving me mentally drained by the day’s end.</p>\n<p>My current hypothesis is that, at least for now, effectively managing or orchestrating these agents requires maintaining close oversight through concentrated cycles of deep work. During the intervals when the agent is actively running, I’ve experimented with keeping the project open in an IDE like Cursor. This allows me to ask clarifying questions in plain English to quickly regain context, verify what the agent is accomplishing, or even perform quality checks on the code itself. For particularly challenging issues, I escalate exceptions to more advanced tools like <a href=\"https://o1.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">o1 Pro</a> or Deep Research.</p>\n<p>In essence, managing agents today feels akin to overseeing a product team conducting research, implementation, and code reviews somewhat concurrently. As these agents become more reliable, it might become increasingly feasible to manage multiple projects simultaneously—a practice I’ve successfully employed on the services side, managing around five clients daily. However, unlike the serial management of clients, agent orchestration involves parallel task management.</p>\n<p>Traditional frameworks like OKRs may offer useful insights into managing human teams, but this emerging space—where tasks unfold in increments of an hour or less—feels novel from a managerial perspective. I’ll continue to document and share effective practices as I develop them.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Some thoughts on how and \"where\" agents fit into the traditional software product development process:</p>\n<p>I think all these things coexist. It's on a spectrum from DIY to traditional software. Agents with flexibly composed workflows are more expensive but more general. Then you have traditional software workflows just with LLMs. And finally, highly specified deductive reasoning style software that's correlated with cost and speed (inversely correlated with cost and positively correlated with speed).</p>\n<p>So, the bottom line is if you wanna scale something horizontally you can just move along this spectrum from agent to traditional software. I don't think all that much changes fundamentally except that there are all these little niche problems where agents or humans and agents can take a crack at it first. And it just... This might be the case that they discover something that could turn into a scalable software product of some kind.</p>\n<p>The real upshot here is that it's no longer prohibitively expensive to create incredibly bespoke and personalized workflow automation tools. Some of these might turn into profitable products, and most won't, but the cycle time to delivery and rate of experimentation can happen so much more quickly because of these more general albeit more expensive systems. You can delegate tasks from zero to one to one to ten is important and should really invite executives to more seriously consider how they can adjust corporate policies and establish internal norms that encourage bottoms-up experimentation with this extremely general technology and decentralized IT in a prudent way.</p>\n<p>[The attached image is from a recent presentation that I gave to a group of Financial Services executives unpacking this concept.]</p>\n",

Even though I can’t share the full recap here (you can go <a href=\"https://www.okrmentors.com/courses/take/okr-forum-2025/lessons/62399370-ai-strategy-execution\" target=\"_blank\">purchase it as part of the full [and excellent!] OKR Forum event recap</a>), I wanted to pass along a few highlights that really struck home for me—especially on how AI supercharges OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) and strategy execution.</p><hr><p><strong>AI + OKRs: A Perfect Match</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the points I hammered home (and wholeheartedly believe) is how well AI dovetails with OKRs. OKRs are all about continuous learning, experimentation, and focusing on outcomes that matter. AI is basically an accelerant for these processes—it lets you spin up new products and prototypes faster, handle enormous amounts of data in real time, and reduce the tedious overhead that often stifles creativity.</p>\n\n<p>I like to say I’m practically a cyborg these days, using AI for everything from drafting complex pieces of code to analyzing meeting transcripts. Why? Because AI transforms mundane “information tasks” into strategic learning moments.</p><hr><p><strong>Two Concrete Examples</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Front-End Intelligence:</strong> Before setting each quarter’s objectives, I love to gather insight directly from frontline folks or customers. Instead of sending out forms or relying on multiple reporting layers, I spin up an AI-powered <em>voice agent</em> (think of it like an automated interviewer with excellent follow-up questions). I’ll send out a phone number, let employees and customers dial in, and collect nuanced feedback that a static survey can’t capture. It’s faster, more natural, and you can analyze the transcripts right away.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prototyping on the Fly:</strong> Once OKRs spotlight a new opportunity (say, a potential product feature), you can turn those verbal “what-ifs” into actual working code. Just feed a transcript or a bulleted list of requirements into a generative model—o1 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or whatever powerful tool you like—and get a near-instant draft of the concept. You don’t have to assemble a full dev team just to see if something is valuable (and possibly even technically feasible). That allows you to execute at unprecedented speed.</p></li></ol><hr><p><strong>Privacy, Policy & the (Inevitable) Shadow AI</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, all this capability comes with serious responsibilities. One big watchout is privacy. You can’t just drop proprietary or regulated data into a free, consumer-grade product and hope it stays confidential. Corporate policies matter—so leaders need to anticipate <em>how</em> employees will use AI rather than trying to lock it down. Because here’s the thing: if you don’t give people the right sanctioned tools and guidelines, “shadow AI” will pop up anyway (as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pkokrs?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAACv7FUBS4I5buElxV7ytAumA0woD9ATJGc\">Peter Kerr</a> mentioned, just like those “shadow IT” Excel macros we used to see everywhere).</p><hr><p><strong>Decentralize Innovation—and Then “Show & Tell”</strong></p>\n\n<p>A big theme that came up in our panel is the tension between centralized IT policy and the grassroots user-driven innovation that AI makes possible. My take is that we should <em>welcome</em> decentralized experimentation—within guardrails. Let your people flex their creativity and find new AI hacks, but set up an internal “Show & Tell” rhythm. Every week or two, let those folks share what they’re building, how they did it, and what results they’re seeing. That’s how you unstick knowledge from individual silos and spread it throughout the company.</p><hr><p><strong>My Favorite Prompt to End Each Week</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here’s a hack I’ve been using lately: Every week, I take transcripts from my key meetings, feed them into a robust large language model (like o1 Pro with the expanded context window), and ask:</p><ol><li><p>“What’s the most ,

Honestly, give yourself a good 1-5 minutes to simply think and articulate the thoughts that pop out of your head via a dictation tool like <a href=\"https://whisperflow.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wispr Flow</a> or <a href=\"https://superwhisper.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">superwhisper</a> and put it into <a href=\"https://o1.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">o1 Pro</a> along with whatever other salient digital records you can spin up.</p>\n<p>It's not quite as snappy as using the other models, and this violates a bit of one of my good practices that I recommend to clients: \"speed is the name of the game\" when it comes to AI experiments. 5 minutes is long enough that you can go accomplish some other task in the meantime. With that amount of time comes expectations of higher quality which you can absolutely deliver on. But that means that you really need to think through what your ask is and can you provide the system with the relevant information so it can go think about it for you.</p>\n<p>To give a very concrete example, I'm giving a presentation to some highly regulated industry C-levels in a few weeks. I had set up a voice assistant via <a href=\"https://vapi.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vapi</a> to ask them/attendees a series of discovery questions and ended up generating 6 different long-form transcripts prior to even diving in and reading the transcripts sue or not. I popped it all into <a href=\"https://o1.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">o1 Pro</a>, gave it lots of context about what it was that I was trying to do with the presentation, how I'm thinking about this strategically, and frankly a lot of details that are just not documented or at least indexed and compressed in a way that I can copy and paste. Your intentions and goals are always somewhat latent, so I've found that it's incredibly important to verbally articulate those each time you use one of these systems (this is probably the no. 2 or 3 mistake I see users make — not clearly articulating their intent before hitting enter; this usually requires some deeper thinking by the user, but is a necessary \"literacy\" in the context of AI IMO).</p>\n<p>Anyway, it \"thought\" for about 4 minutes, and my goodness, am I blown away by the quality of the output here.</p>\n<p>We're really moving up another level of the abstraction ladder: I didn't really have to specify a particular format or output structure that I wanted, and by not doing that, I gave it the flexibility to figure out the best way to present its findings in regard to what their top concern is and how I might be able to take the best next step in the context of what I'm trying to do.</p>\n<p>It really does feel like you have a top-tier consulting firm analyst at your disposal for less than $10/day.</p>\n<p>Crazy stuff.</p>\n<p>You just have to rethink the way that you're using these tools and optimize for quality while slowing down quite a bit at least compared to what you could do with previous model generations.</p>\n<p>Anyone else getting this kind of juice out of their Pro sub?</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Ever wonder if generative AI can truly 10x your productivity—or if it’s just hype?</p>\n<p>From my experience, there’s one limiting factor and two bottlenecks you need to keep in mind—whether you’re in “single-player mode” (becoming the 10x version of your specialized role) or “multiplayer mode” (transforming how cross-functional teams and entire enterprises operate).</p>\n<p>Limiting Factor: Access to State-of-the-Art Models</p>\n<p>If your team can’t use top-tier models—like <a href=\"https://o1.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">o1 Pro</a> or Sonnet 3.5—right away, you’re starting at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Bottleneck #1: Getting Salient Context & High-Fidelity Data Into the Model</p>\n<p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: more is more. Meeting transcripts, CRM logs, support exchanges, code bases, knowledge articles, or social media threads—feeding your model with high-quality, proprietary data raises the odds of a meaningful first-turn output.</p>\n<p>Yet most automated retrieval systems are still clunky. You end up hopping between apps, downloading or converting files, and copy/pasting text. That’s a tough sell for most people—unless they’ve already had that “magic moment,” where a task that used to take days (or weeks) gets done in a few hours. Once they see that, they’re hooked; until then, every extra click is a barrier.</p>\n<p>Bottleneck #2: Getting Data Out of Your Head</p>\n<p>We’ve been trained to type everything, but talking—literally speaking your thought process for 10 or 20 minutes—often prompts richer responses. The model can then engage in a true back-and-forth, helping you discover insights you might otherwise miss with short typed prompts.</p>\n<p>The Dawn of Agentic Systems</p>\n<p>This is especially relevant now that “agentic” AI—systems that do their own clicking, copying, and pasting—may arrive soon. Models like <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> 3.5 Sonnet already chain multiple steps: pulling code from a repository, running bash commands locally, capturing outputs, and using that info to decide on next steps before giving you a final result. It’s surprisingly capable if you set it up properly (e.g., <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Desktop, new MCP servers).</p>\n<p>Implications for Enterprises</p>\n<p>As these agentic tools mature, the gap widens between those who leverage them (orchestrating AI at a high level) and those stuck in old-school knowledge workflows. My biggest concern is that centralized IT in many enterprises moves too slowly, risking the loss of top talent who want more flexible, efficient tools.</p>\n<p>In my view, this is the real bottleneck to achieving “true multiplayer mode” with AI: slow, centralized IT. Ironically, IT might be the first department in need of radical reform.</p>\n<p>Where do you see AI making the biggest impact in your organization—or your career? Let me know in the comments—I’d love to hear your experiences and insights!</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>When I was at MIT Sloan, I was fortunate to take a class taught by Professor Eric Von Hippel. In this class, I learned about user-led innovation, the sticky information problem, and several other deeply insightful concepts from his research and work. These concepts profoundly changed the way I think about product development, entrepreneurship, and the practical application of general-purpose technology, like generative AI.</p>\n<p>Whenever I'm surprised by the creative ways users of the products have contributed to developments during feedback and discovery interviews, I feel energized. This happened last night when I caught up with one of my private alpha participants. He figured out a clever solution to a dilemma he faced. On one extreme, he had zero insight into meetings he didn't attend, and on the other, he was attending every meeting. The solution was to have employees use their Fireflies note-taker to join meetings. He could then find out important details through his daily pulse message and communicate with Spark, his AI chief of staff.</p>\n<p>However, there was another category he hadn't considered: meetings he might want to attend or get more visibility into immediately after, without being present for the entire duration. He realized he could send his Fireflies note-taker and give other attendees a heads up. This would trigger my product to send notes at the meeting level rather than waiting for all aggregation the next day.</p>\n<p>This brilliant little innovation is something I'm excited to share with my other customers. It's another unexpected insight I'm gaining as I work with clients to apply AI, which is primarily a social technology, for more efficient information sharing and ultimately accelerating growth.</p>\n",

Maybe 18 months ago, I worked on a project with another applied AI SME & Melior CEO Ryan Markman, where we used large language models to map an ideal customer profile to all the unstructured data associated with each LinkedIn profile in a shared pool of a company's employees' connections.</p>\n<p>I honestly didn't think it was going to work much better than standard keyword search, but lo and behold, it ended up doubling their pipeline.</p>\n<p>What that told me was that there was a massive opportunity to use AI to make the network-based search process significantly easier. In practice, this would mean giving relatively less weight to traditional inbound and outbound connections and significantly more to sidebound or nearbound à la Crossbeam, since those trusted first-degree connections, especially happy customers, are so valuable.</p>\n<p>Until now, the cost of figuring out who the second and third-degree connections are, that could yield a fruitful interaction, was quite expensive and often prohibitive.</p>\n<p>With some help from George I even built something that took my own LinkedIn network and after every call (David I demoed for your group IIRC): I would take the transcript, popped it in, and it would automatically search through my connections to find exactly the right person for the other party to speak to, given their precise challenges in the transcripts.</p>\n<p>It actually worked pretty well (hit rate was maybe 1 fruitful connection every 10 days) but became quite expensive b/c the price of GPT-4 was still quite high, and the models weren't quite good enough for daily workflow use. It's been over a year and the technology has improved significantly — and ta-da: Happenstance has arrived.</p>\n<p>Given that Y Combinator companies tend to be quite good, I expect that these guys will figure out something pretty important.</p>\n<p>All that said, I'm definitely going to experiment with it and report back on the results.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I'll be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>searching through my network after every call by</li>\n<li>popping the Fireflies.ai transcript into <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> Pro to</li>\n<li>identify the other person's top unmet need (latent or made explicit) and</li>\n<li>articulate the abstract persona I’d want to search for among my first and second-degree connections who would most likely be able to help the person I just spoke with, and perhaps even</li>\n<li>draft an intro email if it makes sense.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you'd like to give this a go yourself, in the interim, you can join my network via the link in the comments.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>The job loss discourse around AI drives me nuts.</p>\n<p>No \"one\" is getting replaced.</p>\n<p>Roles (jobs) are bundles of tasks. In light of computers that can read, write, and reason, it should be self-evident that these roles will necessarily be unbundled, and the tasks of which they are comprised delegated accordingly, many to machines that can now handle them. The overall process is then decomposed into new bundles that may, at first, seem rather alien.</p>\n<p>Yes, this way of working looks different than what we've gotten used to in the 20th century. Yes, this presents challenges, especially for people who derive a lot of self-worth from their ability to primarily do something a certain way, with the outcome being secondary.</p>\n<p>Just embrace it. Everyone has access to the technology.</p>\n<p>With the release of the reasoning models, it's not that there might be wage deflation in traditional white-collar roles. There already is deflation, just not widely diffused. The rate at which this happens is largely a consequence of macroeconomic factors and policy issues outside the scope of this post. However, this overall trajectory is significantly less uncertain than it was even a year ago.</p>\n<p>If you thought that by getting on a particular career track, you would be guaranteed some sort of income by doing things in a certain way, then I'm sorry. The reality is quite different, and with happiness being something like reality minus expectations, this will be the source of some tribulation.</p>\n<p>However, what I can guarantee you is that on the other side of a radical retooling effort, your real wages, degrees of freedom, and overall energy levels will be significantly higher. But this all starts with the realization that you don't deserve a single thing, especially in a relatively free global market.</p>\n<p>To make meaningful progress, you must anchor your \"objective function\" to some other person's satisfaction that a real problem they have—a barrier in the way of attaining their own good goals—has been satisfactorily removed by you through a combination of technology and action. Get the reps in, and you will generate new expertise that will allow you to differentiate yourself, which is the source of wage appreciation and profit.</p>\n<p>Fate leads the willing and drags the unwilling. Today would be a good day to get started on the path into the 21st century.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how to create a truly externally-facing AI presence that doesn’t just imitate old-school methods. There are basically three approaches I’ve seen so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Website Chatbots</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can drop a chatbot on your homepage—but, it never quite feels right. Most of the time, it’s just an annoying pop-up that interrupts a user who’s trying to read or navigate.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Clones</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You build an AI persona that's a stand-in for “you,” fielding inbound questions at scale. It can handle repetitive FAQs, but unless you have a massive audience, it's hard to justify the UX tradeoff: the models aren't quite there when it comes to getting your \"vibe\" across, and while that gap will close as the core tech gets better, there may end up being a pretty deep uncanny valley.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>A New Way? (Outbound & Helpful)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Instead of automating your voice to trick people into thinking they’re talking to a human (the worst of this being pseudo-personalized email & LinkedIn spam), why not design an AI persona from scratch—something that transparently shows up as a helpful assistant when folks post about the very topics you’re great at?</p>\n<p>This “third way” is about a new kind of relationship-building:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The AI assistant engages in a right-sized, context-aware way.</li>\n<li>It’s clearly labeled as a bot, so no one feels duped.</li>\n<li>It offers real value—maybe asks a clarifying question or shares a relevant tip—just enough to build a modicum of trust.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The hope is that people see this AI persona, realize it’s genuinely helpful, and then decide to learn more about what you (and your product or service) can do. It’s a fresh approach that avoids the spammy “carnival barker” vibe & allows you to scale your know-how a bit by taking you out of the loop (key insight here: instant replies to posts have EXTREMELY high response rates; being able to close the loop in a few seconds rather than a few hours, let alone a few days is produces qualitatively different results, and this is only really possible if you delegate some small action to intelligent, discursive, semi-autonomous media).</p>\n<p>I’m actually spinning up this concept for Powerline’s “Spark”—the remote team CEO's AI chief-of-staff. It’ll go out on Twitter in the near future, interact thoughtfully with people who seem to need a little help, and (hopefully) nurture those relationships in a way that’s both human-friendly and scalable.</p>\n<p>All of this goes back to my core belief in quality over quantity—not churning out more meaningless content, AKA \"LLM slop,\" or “faking it” online, but reimagining how AI can genuinely enhance conversations. I’ll report back on the results once it’s live.</p>\n<p>Mark Amtower, thanks again for the lively discussion that got this out of my head...</p>\n<p>(If you’re curious, I’ll drop a link in the comments to some of the discussion that sparked this idea!)</p>\n",

(These bottlenecks led us to develop the various corporate forms, good & best management practices, etc. that we now largely take for granted — some of these will prove durable; most of what's been published in the \"business books\" section will not.)</p>\n<p>I increasingly advocate for radical reform (~50% of my income comes from implementation, so we're beyond the speculation phase), not just of existing institutions in light of AI, but more importantly in how financiers, entrepreneurs, and lawmakers with an eye toward the frontier pursue their projects and implement infrastructure for durable growth.</p>\n<p>When you consider allocating your attention or resources to something you believe will move things forward, pause and consider if there might be AI-powered components that can accelerate your progress tenfold.</p>\n<p>This consideration has transformed my participation in the economy and helped me overcome the limiting factors and beliefs of the 20th century, allowing me to create new roles and adopt the skill sets and mindset needed to thrive in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>What will this mean for you?</p>\n<p>IDK — but things that were impossible are now possible; go forth and find out!</p>\n",

    "title": "From Resistance to Results: Three Practical Benefits of Using AI Note-Takers Like Fireflies",
    "date": "2024-12-20",
    "content": " <p>As I spoke about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markamtower?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAADZO0B232BL7ofYVNNlcbJIbc34kDoRfk\">Mark Amtower</a> this morning, in the world of government contracting (GovCon) and beyond, <em>operational efficiency</em> often hinges on a delicate balance: driving innovation forward while respecting organizational culture, workflows, and stakeholder concerns. When it comes to adopting AI-driven meeting tools—like my personal favorite, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/fireflies-inc/\">Fireflies.ai</a>, a note-taking and transcription assistant—this balance can feel especially tricky. Employees may worry about privacy, added complexity to their existing workflows, or feeling “surveilled,” even if the tool’s purpose is to help everyone operate at a higher level.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, I’ve found that the key to smooth adoption isn’t to simply enforce top-down mandates, but to highlight clear, personal benefits that resonate with individuals, especially those on the front lines of customer engagement. If you can help that first customer-facing employee see the upside, you’ll build the trust and momentum you need for broader organizational buy-in — and to realize outsized value from <a href=\"https://powerline.bot\" target=\"_blank\">c-suite AI tools like POWERLINE</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here are three ways an AI note-taker can deliver immediate wins:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Faster Follow-Up and Reduced Busywork</strong></p>\n\n<p>We’ve all been there—after a detailed conversation with a client or a prospect, you’ve got to scramble to produce accurate call summaries, draft follow-up emails, or log action items into the CRM. AI note-takers remove much of this burden by transcribing the meeting in real time. That means the attendee can focus on being present and responsive during the call rather than scribbling down notes. Post-meeting, generating polished follow-up emails or extracting key action items from a transcript is as quick and seamless as popping the transcript into a state-of-the-art AI tool like ChatGPT or Claude. The result? Less time lost to busywork and a faster, higher-quality response to the customer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Seamless Compliance and Reporting</strong></p>\n\n<p>For many organizations, especially in GovCon, maintaining compliance and navigating complex contractual requirements can be a huge lift. Instead of manually transferring notes into a compliance log or a database, AI tools help automate that process. With a searchable transcript, employees can quickly find the details they need, confirm compliance steps, and generate the necessary documentation. This makes internal audits and reporting a breeze, freeing up time and cognitive bandwidth for more strategic tasks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Continuous Improvement Through Coaching and Insight</strong></p>\n\n<p>Think of AI-generated transcripts as a coaching resource. After a meeting, employees can review what was said, when it was said, and how the conversation flowed. Paired with AI-driven analysis, teams can identify patterns, spot opportunities, and refine messaging strategies. In a sales or client management setting, this may mean quickly detecting common objections, discovering which talking points resonate most, or highlighting cross-sell opportunities. Over time, your team isn’t just saving effort—they’re actually growing more effective, honing their skills, and improving client relationships, and with minimal managerial overhead!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Starting Small, Building Momentum</strong></p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this approach is that you don’t have to push everyone onto the platform at once. Start with one or two customer-facing staff who are open to testing the tool. Help them leverage the time savings, compliance benefits, and coaching insights. As they experience the tangible value—less scramble after calls, smoother handoffs, and improved client outcomes—their enthusiasm naturally spreads. Their peers start to ask, “How can I get in on this?” Instead of a top-down command, you’ve created a bottom-up pull for AI-driven efficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Model for Broader Change</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although we’re focusing on Fireflies and meeting transcription here, these principles apply to other AI-enabled transformations. Organizations facing uncertain times, whether in public or private sectors, thrive when they align technology adoption with frontline needs. By showing people a concrete benefit in their day-to-day work, you reduce friction and build a foundation (via a durable <strong>data asset</strong> and new organizational <em>know-how</em>) for more ambitious operational improvements down the line.</p>\n\n<p>As year-end approaches and many of us reconsider our tech stacks and productivity tools, now might be the perfect time to experiment. <a href=\"https://fireflies.ai\" target=\"_blank\">Try AI note-taking for a single meeting.</a> See if it slashes the follow-up hassle. Gauge the improvement in accuracy and turnaround. If it works, you’ve got a blueprint for rolling out other smart tools that don’t just record what’s said—they help everyone become better at what they do.</p> ",

and</p></li><li><p>commands a nice premium over traditional SaaS seat-based licenses by trading a massive reduction in marginal clicks for high-3-to-even-4-figures of revenue per month (particularly relevant: the perennial <a target=\"_blank\">Stratechery</a> insight in re the relative impossibility of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2010/apple-innovators-dilemma/?t\" target=\"_blank\">\"overshooting\" good UX</a>).</p></li></ol><p>Three possible instantiations of the above (yes, this is an explicit invitation to build these—I would pay a premium for all three!):</p><ol><li><p>a \"<strong>business developer</strong>\" that facilitates fruitful connections via deep, deep research prior to bidding for the principal's limited attention (related: one of the main bottlenecks going forward will be human attention, i.e., the rate of improvement of context window length is surely greater than our own, or <em>we're all executives now</em>); an MVP of this might be a <strong>matchmaking system</strong> that facilitates the fewest, most surprising connections between conference attendees prior to the event given some publicly available information about the ticketholders and a modicum of information in re their goals, what's salient, etc., all of which can be elicited during a short phone conversation via a voice assistant like <a target=\"_blank\">Vapi</a>;</p></li><li><p>a \"<strong>recruiter</strong>\" that does search across not-only-human candidates and even breaks the FTE/contractor models by default: Given some rich data (again, let's say, meeting or call transcripts), this flavor of agentic system should be able to d<strong>erive the no. 1 problem their principal faces</strong> (I can tell you from experience, by the way, that this is often latent in the unstructured source material, not apparent those who face the problem, but <strong>legible to state-of-the-art foundation models</strong>), performs a massively broad search across specialist software solutions (which could be products for people or <strong>tools for agents</strong> with deeper access to their principal's secrets), hyper-differentiated individual SMEs (i.e., AI-powered services solopreneurs, which is already emerging labor category...I know this, in part, <em>because I am one</em>) who are open to outcome-based compensation, and then, on the margin, your more traditional specialist shops/agencies or—GASP—a part- or full-time hire;

I'm talking <em>actual personalization</em> (in the sense of personalism and <a href=\"https://primematters.com/foundations/search-truth/studiositas-and-curiositas\" target=\"_blank\"><em>studiositas</em></a> vs. the potent combination of pride/envy/curiositas that drives so much digital media consumption at the moment).</p></li></ol><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/perplexity-ai/\">Perplexity</a>, Google's new Gemini <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Research</a> product, and o1 with <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/o1-and-new-tools-for-developers/\" target=\"_blank\">tools and variable TTC</a> are great first steps.</p>\n\n<p>I look forward to seeing how entrepreneurs, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_if-theres-one-thing-you-commit-to-in-2025-activity-7274438151656411136-9kNH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>including and especially YOU!</strong></a>, take the aforementioned capabilities to the next level in '25—and reporting back on what I learn as I integrate these nascent, next-gen AI capabilities deeper into my and my clients' workflows, all the way from <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerated-ai-adoption-christian-ulstrup-9wgke/\" target=\"_blank\">single-player to multiplayer modes</a>.</p> ",

    "content": " <h3>A Three-Level Maturity Model and How to Make the Shift From Single-Player to Multiplayer Mode</h3><blockquote><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/gsd-at-work/\">GSD at Work LLC</a> AAA Playbook Primer</p></blockquote><p>Generative AI is under-hyped as a core productivity driver; however, achieving those outsized org-wide gains c-levels have been promised for ~2 years now can be challenging.</p>\n\n<p>That said, when things go right, the technology can help you achieve your existing goals dramatically faster—sometimes by an order of magnitude—and unlock new product/market frontiers that help you stay ahead of your competition.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, as we head into 2025, over two years since ChatGPT was originally launched, many organizations struggle to move beyond a handful of early adopters tinkering in private. How can you scale these capabilities so that entire teams, departments, and eventually your whole enterprise benefit?</p>\n\n<p>To answer this, I’ve developed a \"scale invariant*\" three-level <em>Accelerated AI Adoption</em> Maturity Model. This framework shows you how to evolve from individual experimentation (single-player mode) to organization-wide transformation (multiplayer mode). By progressing through these levels, you’ll cultivate a more adaptive, open, and continuously improving culture—one that thrives on user-led innovation and seizes new value streams at every turn.</p><blockquote><p>*it works for organizations of any size: from bootstrapped indie founders to massive enterprises</p></blockquote><p><strong>Level 1: Individual Productivity & Data Asset Creation</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Maximize personal efficiency with AI, while generating rich data assets that set the stage for more complex workflows later.</p>\n\n<p>At this initial stage, the focus is on you—your own productivity, learning curve, and personal data workflow. <strong>Core capabilities</strong> include:</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Speech-to-Text Dictation:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Stop typing, start talking.</em> Use tools like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/superwhisper/\">superwhisper</a> (or, if you must, OS built-in dictation) to get your thoughts into the machine rapidly, providing high-context input to AI systems. This accelerates your brainstorming and helps you think in real-time with your AI “thought partner”; unlike Google Search, the key to getting the most out of these systems is, \"more is more,\" meaning get as much salient context out of your head as quickly as you can and then into the AI system (vs. the three-keyword web search queries we've become accustomed to carefully crafting over the past two decades).</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>General-Purpose AI Chat Interfaces:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tools like ChatGPT (especially the new Pro / Teams offerings) or Anthropic’s Claude equivalents serve as your personal AI assistant. They can help you rewrite text, draft memos, generate new ideas, or parse complex documents; this technology is truly one of those rare (maybe once in a century?) general purpose technologies that unlock qualitative changes in both <em>what's feasible</em> and <em>how work gets done</em>. Start with a basic subscription and level up as you become a heavier user.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Automated Meeting Note-Takers:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Capture all your discussions with a tool like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/fireflies-inc/\">Fireflies.ai</a>. Recording conversations and making them searchable transforms transient meetings into long-lasting data assets; as I mentioned before, more is more, so the more salient data you have (and these raw primary sources are absolute <strong>gold</strong>, especially as the models get smarter, allowing them to perceive meaningful insight contained therein, not unlike a digital microscope), the more you'll get out of the general purpose tools à la Chat. Cultivate a habit of feeding this trove of transcripts into AI models for analysis, insights, and acceleration. </p>\n\n<p>A great way to get started is to pipe a transcript into the most powerful you have access to after a meeting, and ask it to 1) act as your trusted advisor and give feedback, 2) draft a follow-up email, and 3) suggest an action item that no-one explicitly mentioned that you can perform in 60 seconds or less.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Personal productivity skyrockets, but more ,

    "date": "2024-12-02",
    "content": "<p>Had an eye-opening conversation yesterday about why large organizations struggle with AI transformation, despite the clear potential for 10x productivity gains.</p>\n<p>It reminded me of a fascinating parallel from history: the adoption of electricity in factories.</p>\n<p>Initially, companies simply retrofitted their old factories with electrical power, seeing only incremental gains. The real revolution came when factories were fundamentally redesigned around electricity's capabilities.</p>\n<p>Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>Today's large organizations face a similar crossroads with AI.</p>\n<p>Through my conversations with leaders across industries, I've identified two critical barriers:</p>\n<p>First, the structural challenge: Multiple management layers and slow, politically-charged goal-setting processes dilute any sense of urgency for transformation. When you're several layers removed from strategic decision-making, it's hard to feel empowered to drive radical change.</p>\n<p>Second, the compensation barrier: Traditional, rigid leveling systems discourage innovation. When your compensation is banded regardless of output, where's the incentive to achieve that 10x productivity gain? I'm seeing talented employees who master AI tools either quietly reducing their workload or leaving for more dynamic environments.</p>\n<p>Here's the reality: The path to successful AI transformation isn't about broadly deploying tools like <a href=\"https://copilot.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Copilot</a> and hoping for an aggregate 10% productivity boost. It's about identifying and empowering the 1-5% of employees who can drive exponential gains. These champions typically share key traits: intellectual humility, deep curiosity, high verbal intelligence, and enough experience to know what \"good\" looks like without being set in their ways.</p>\n<p>The winning strategy? It's threefold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide universal access to general-purpose AI tools (e.g., Fireflies.ai, <a href=\"https://superwhisper.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">superwhisper</a>, <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a>)</li>\n<li>Create forums for knowledge sharing (e.g., weekly show-and-tells)</li>\n<li>Formalize cross-functional teams around your identified champions to tackle mission-critical initiatives</li>\n<li>\" Optional, but highly recommended: Stay in the loop (and address risks/seize opportunities) by installing AI-powered eyes & ears across the org with <a href=\"https://powerline.bot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://powerline.bot</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>But, remember — none of this works long-term without rethinking compensation structures: i.e., moving from rigid, leveled systems to outcome-based rewards that incentivize innovation and productivity gains.</p>\n<p>The stakes are high. Companies that cling to 20th-century organizational structures while implementing 21st-century tools risk alienating their best talent.</p>\n<p>Unlike the physical constraints of the industrial revolution, today's digital landscape allows for rapid, radical transformation of value chains—if you have the courage to pursue it.</p>\n<p>What's your experience with AI transformation in large organizations? Are you seeing similar patterns? Let's discuss in the comments.</p>\n<p>#AITransformation #OrganizationalChange #Innovation #Leadership #FutureOfWork</p>\n",

    "title": "From Queries to Conversations: AI and the Evolution of \"Search",
    "date": "2024-11-26",
    "content": " <p>Remember the last time you sat down with a truly exceptional advisor or mentor? They didn't just wait for you to ask questions. Instead, they asked you the kind of penetrating questions that helped clarify your thinking and unlock new insights. This is exactly where search engines are headed—and it's going to transform how we interact with information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Limitations of Today's Search</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our current relationship with search engines (and tools for traversing information space, which I'd use more broadly to include LLM-powered tools like ChatGPT) is fundamentally reactive. We type in queries, and they respond with a list of potentially relevant results. This approach puts the entire burden of asking the right questions on us. </p>\n\n<p>But what if we don't know what we don't know? What if we're missing critical context or approaching a problem from the wrong angle entirely?</p>\n\n<p>This limitation becomes particularly acute for executives and leaders dealing with complex decisions. When every minute counts, scrolling through search results and iteratively refining queries isn't just inefficient; it's a missed opportunity for deeper insight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Power of Being Asked the Right Questions</strong></p><blockquote><p>The search engines of the future will ask <em>you</em> questions...</p></blockquote><p>The right question at the right moment can stop you in your tracks. It can make you realize you've been focusing on the wrong problem, help you see a blind spot, or illuminate an opportunity you hadn't considered. This is why the best advisors, coaches, and mentors are masters at asking questions.</p>\n\n<p>Now, imagine having an AI-powered search engine that could do the same. Instead of passively waiting for your query, it would actively engage with you in a dialogue, drawing on its comprehensive understanding of your context, history, and goals—all while respecting every slice of your attention, not notifying you incessantly to develop a habit (or \"stickier\" product à la the social media platforms of the past 20 years), but rather distilling the remaining gaps between where you are and where you want to be into a perfectly-timed, personalized, punchy question.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What This Future Looks Like</strong></p>\n\n<p>Picture this: You open ChatGPT, Claude, Google, or any other internet portal, and instead of a blank search box, you're greeted with a thoughtful question about your most pressing business challenge. The system has already analyzed patterns in your recent activities, monitored relevant market trends, and identified potential opportunities or risks you should consider.</p>\n\n<p>(And, even better, you don't type a single key in response; you only need to speak your mind, and the system will begin engaging with you through spoken and auditory dialogue.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>For example:</strong></p><ul><li><blockquote><p>I noticed you've been researching supply chain optimization. Have you considered how recent changes in Asian manufacturing policies might impact your strategy?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Your team has been focused on customer acquisition, but the data suggests retention might be a more pressing issue. Should we explore why?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>There's an emerging trend in your industry that connects to a project you worked on last quarter. Would you like to understand the implications?</p></blockquote></li></ul><p><strong>Beyond Simple Information Retrieval</strong></p>\n\n<p>This evolution represents a fundamental shift from information retrieval to proactive, intelligent guidance. The search engine of the future will ask <em>you</em> questions, towards the following ends:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identifying Blind Spots</strong>: By proactively raising questions about areas you might have overlooked</p></li><li><p><strong>Challenging Assumptions</strong>: Through targeted questions that help you examine your premises</p></li><li><p><strong>Connecting Dots</strong>: By highlighting relationships between seemingly unrelated pieces of information</p></li><li><p><strong>Driving Action</strong>: By turning insights into concrete next steps, and making it easy for you to overcome inertia</p></li></ol><p><strong>The Organizational Impact</strong></p>\n\n<p>For businesses, this shift will be transformative. Instead of employees spending hours sifting through information, they'll engage in high-value dialogues with AI systems that help them arrive at better decisions faster. This is particularly crucial given recent studies showing that professionals spend an inordinate amount of time in unproductive information-gathering activities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for Leaders</strong></p>\n\n<p>For executives and decision-makers, this evolution in search technology will serve as a form of \"cognitive augmentation.\" It will help:</p><ul><li><p>Focus attention on what truly matters</p></li><li><p>Identify emerging opportunities and risks earlier</p></li><li><p>Make better-informed decisions faster</p></li><li><p>Stay ahead of market trends and changes</p></li></ul><h3>The Path Forward</h3>\n\n<p>This transformation won't happen overnight, but it's already beginning. The rapid advancement of large language models and AI systems that can engage in sophisticated reasoning is laying the groundwork for this future.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, we're already seeing early implementations of this vision in specialized domains. At <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/gsd-at-work/\">GSD at Work LLC</a> , we've been working on this exact problem for CEOs and executives through our new product <a href=\"https://powerline.bot\" target=\"_blank\">POWERLINE</a>, an AI chief-of-staff that proactively asks the right questions and surfaces critical insights from across your organization.</p>\n\n<p>The key to making these systems work is developing them in ways that:</p><ul><li><p>Build trust through consistently valuable insights</p></li><li><p>Respect privacy and security concerns</p></li><li><p>Integrate seamlessly with existing workflows</p></li><li><p>Provide transparent reasoning for their questions and suggestions</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>The search engines of the future won't just wait for your questions—they'll ask you the questions you should be asking yourself. This shift from reactive to proactive search will fundamentally change how we interact with information and make decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The winners in this new era will be those who embrace these systems not just as tools for finding information, but as partners in thinking, planning, and decision-making. The future of search isn't just about better answers; it's about better questions.</p>\n\n<p>Are you ready for a future where your technology asks you the hard questions you need to hear?</p><hr><blockquote><p>Want to experience this future today? POWERLINE, currently in private alpha (with a limited one-time, one-year discount available to the next cohort of participants), is offering CEOs early access to an AI chief of staff that proactively surfaces insights and asks the right questions to drive your business forward.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Apply now for early access pricing: </em><a href=\"https://powerline.bot\" target=\"_blank\"><em>https://powerline.bot</em></a><em> </p></blockquote> ",

You need to TAKE ACTION!</p>\n<p>(And, especially at the beginning, it can be excruciatingly uncomfortable, especially if you're coming in with limiting beliefs like, \"I can't code!\")</p>\n<p>Remember, there are no experts in AI, only pioneers, and the dynamic nature of the technology is such that real gains can only be achieved through rapid experimentation in a domain that you find energizing and, if sufficiently navigated / ordered with the help of this technology, would lead to better outcomes for the customers and colleagues who benefit from your hard work.</p>\n<p>Especially at the beginning of the retooling journey, much of the investment of energy and attention goes into \"muddling through\" the process of making something (again that was impossible to do given the same constraints) good; general principles, good practices, etc. emerge from that process, and some awareness of them prior may be helpful, but it's much better to learn in the course of a real project with acceptance criteria than devouring didactic media on its own.</p>\n<p>So, if you're tempted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sign up for more newsletters,</li>\n<li>watch YouTube tutorials,</li>\n<li>scroll through X for the latest AI goss,</li>\n<li>pay consultants for $X00,000 slideware,</li>\n<li>hire an \"AI expert\" to do standardized company-wide training or seminars...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...DON'T!</p>\n<p>Instead, scope a good goal, muster the energy to suffer through the process of clicking and typing and changing core habits until you've made something that a dispassionate third-party has verified is actually GOOD; only then will you gain the the tacit knowledge that makes it 10x easier to tackle the next task with AI.</p>\n",

Related: might AI be useful as a means of reducing uncertainty, e.g., by simulating high-stakes negotiations with Delphi clones, and enabling generally tighter OODA loops?</li>\n<li>Quantum computing isn't ready for prime time...and may not be for quite a while.

    "content": "<p>AI as \"suprasocial media\" & what happens when we collectively stop typing and start talking...</p>\n<p>There's been some interesting discussion about the accuracy and reliability of AI scribes for doctors (in particular, that there are discrepancies between the doctor or patient's recollection of the visit and what's contained in the machine-generated notes), and that, I think, begs the question of, \"Is rote note-taking even the correct application of this technology in this scenario?</p>\n<p>It's become clear to me that AI is actually a \"discursive\" medium (vs. a broadcast one), and IMO, instead of simply translating a raw recording into EHR-compatible text, the computer should first ask the doctor tough questions post–patient encounter.</p>\n<p>One could make the argument that writing itself is just a simulation of discourse (a less expensive and more accessible technology than the thing you really want, which is a competent and contextually aware thought partner) because you're externalizing your thoughts and interacting with them as they're transmitted back to you visually.</p>\n<p>As Moore's Law moves us closer to resolving Moravec's Paradox (LLMs / GPUs are actually something like the neuronal structures in our \"gut,\" a step below hyper-rational CPU-enabled deductive reasoning), we should expect a shift to oral/discursive communication (and, then, maybe that's supplanted something like vibe-based embodied interaction as spatial and ambient computing technologies mature and eventually dovetail); given the global scale and speed-of-light distribution of information IT enables, the key difference between how our ancestors used those kinds of media and our experience with this new twist on something ancient will be the suprasocial nature of it all: When you interact with an AI, who/what is on the other end?</p>\n<p>It's not a person, but it's not quite a tool either.</p>\n<p>One of the first things I always recommend to clients when they start learning how to use AI to GSD is that they, \"stop typing and start talking.\" It's a tough habit to break, but once you do, the scope of what you can do with computers explodes, since you can more directly input your thoughts into a computer.</p>\n<p>But, as we come to rely on AI-mediated experiences (again, as opposed to the 1:1 display of your unprocessed thoughts reflected to you via word processor), those outputs will be shaped by increasingly incomprehensibly complex (and evolving!) processes, like single cells receiving signals from a CNS.</p>\n<p>All this is to say that, practically, it's becoming more important than ever to unplug periodically. Technology is good; AI is good. But, don't forget to take the exocortex off periodically and \"think naked.\" Otherwise, you may find yourself conforming to the system, rather than participating in it.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>10 things I've come to believe over the past year:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AI will enable a new era of remote, asynchronous, fractional work by lowering barriers of space, time, language and culture. This will accelerate the emergence of global liquid labor markets.</li>\n<li>The most valuable data will come from solving real problems for people at the frontiers of fields. Digitizing both the process and results will allow this data to be leveraged as a complement to increasingly commoditized AI.</li>\n<li>AI's main value is as a compressor and filter - it allows the most important unresolved items to quickly be surfaced so humans can focus their limited attention on what matters most. The key is providing it high-quality, salient data.</li>\n<li>Voice will become the dominant interface for personal computing as AI capabilities grow. This will necessitate rethinking home and office environments to provide privacy for talking to computers.</li>\n<li>Trust is the most important factor for productivity. AI may help build trust at scale by facilitating rich asynchronous interactions and surfacing the most relevant information.</li>\n<li>Corporations will need to fundamentally re-architect themselves around AI, becoming leaner and more muscular. Standard employer-employee relationships will evolve as more tacit knowledge can be digitized.</li>\n<li>The ceiling on individual productivity is rising faster than the floor due to AI. Power users leveraging the tools in sophisticated ways will see exponential gains.</li>\n<li>Curiosity, humility and a focus on doing what energizes you are key to thriving in an AI-powered economy. The goal is reducing uncertainty on the path to ambitious goals.</li>\n<li>We're still very early in the AI transformation, comparable to the early days of electrification. The full implications will take decades to play out but will be profound.</li>\n<li>AI can enhance critical thinking by probing human reasoning with incisive questions. The aim is elevating quality of thought, not delegating thinking to machines.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> for helping me compress all of my posts since '23 into just one :)</p>\n",

Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p>Who do we serve? </p></li><li><p>What problem do we solve for them, and why do they choose us in particular?</p></li><li><p>How could we serve them even better in the future?</p></li></ul><p>This customer-centric approach to mission and vision provides a north star for all subsequent decisions. It's independent of AI (and, best case, the answers are already somewhat self-evident), but will be critical in guiding how you leverage new technological capabilities.</p><hr><p><strong>Body 2: Exploring AI Capabilities</strong></p>\n\n<p>The scope of what can be computed is expanding rapidly. AI is becoming the \"Excel for words\"—and soon, for images, audio, and more exotic data types. To understand what this means for your organization:</p><ol><li><p>Provide access to general-purpose AI tools (e.g., <a target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a>'s ChatGPT Enterprise; <a target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a>'s analogous capabilities, available via cloud platforms like AWS Bedrock; transcription tools like <a target=\"_blank\">superwhisper</a>; AI meeting notetakers like <a target=\"_blank\">Fireflies.ai</a>; asynchronous communication tools like <a target=\"_blank\">Loom</a> x Slack)</p></li><li><p>Explicitly encourage experimentation and tinkering</p></li><li><p>Create channels for sharing learnings (e.g. Slack channels, office hours)</p></li></ol><p>A small percentage of your team will dive in eagerly. These \"AI pioneers\" will uncover new possibilities aligned with your mission. Their experiments will generate valuable, reality-grounded data on what AI can actually do in your specific context.</p><hr><p><strong>Body 3: Redesigning Organizational Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>As AI capabilities become clearer, you'll need to rethink how work is structured. This involves:</p><ol><li><p>Mapping current information and value flows</p></li><li><p>Identifying roles heavy on reading/writing tasks (likely to change significantly)</p></li><li><p>Observing how AI pioneers are \"unbundling\" and \"rebundling\" their tasks</p></li><li><p>Formalizing new AI-native job archetypes</p></li></ol><p>Be prepared for significant changes. Some roles may become obsolete, while others expand. New positions may emerge. Even C-suite titles might need rethinking.</p><hr><p><strong>Putting It All Together: The Transformation Process</strong></p><ol><li><p>Clarify strategic direction</p></li><li><p>Provide AI tools and encourage experimentation (\"user-led innovation\")</p></li><li><p>Set ambitious goals aligned with your mission</p></li><li><p>Create enough space via (3) between <em>where you are</em> and <em>where you should go</em> that you can offer open invitations for people to prudently \"hire AI\" for certain tasks and then step into new roles</p></li><li><p>Identify necessary structural changes</p></li><li><p>Execute changes decisively, while mitigating operational risks</p></li></ol><p>This process reveals pre-existing fit issues and creates space for people to find their new niche. Some may need to retool within the organization, while others may not fit the new paradigm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Word of Caution</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many organizations have overhired or accumulated roles that are no longer critical. The AI revolution may necessitate significant downsizing for some. If this becomes clear, it's often better to make cuts swiftly and cleanly, rather than creating prolonged uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>Before any major restructuring, ensure you have a clear picture of how value flows through your organization to mitigate catastrophic risks.</p>\n\n<p>The Road Ahead</p>\n\n<p>The AI transformation journey is complex and unique for each organization. By viewing it through this three-body framework, leaders can navigate the process more effectively, balancing strategic vision, technological possibilities, and organizational realities.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the goal isn't just to adopt AI – it's to leverage AI in service of your mission, creating more value for those you serve. Organizations that master this balancing act will be well-positioned to thrive in the AI-driven future.</p>\n\n<p>Are you ready to lead your organization through this transformation? Let's connect and discuss how to apply this framework to your specific challenges.</p> ",

Traditionally, this would be prohibitively expensive because of search, onboarding, and switching costs.</p>\n<p>TBH, I used to actually really dislike Loom (which basically records your screen and allows you to provide a voiceover and bundles it into a video message URL you can send) because it puts a huge burden on the recipient to watch a long-form video, which consumes a lot of time and attention just to get the core content.</p>\n<p>But, thanks to AI, it's now really easy to take the transcript of Loom video, pop it into a tool like <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a>, and then quickly get what you need.</p>\n<p>This is a highly recommended habit for high-performing AI native teams.</p>\n<p>The Loom + <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> combo allows you to capture, communicate, and consume information significantly more efficiently while also giving people the freedom to do work when and how they want.</p>\n<p>This also has the nice benefit of passively cultivating a data asset that you can use to grow your business and make training new employees or onboarding contractors ten times as fast.</p>\n<p>Tacit knowledge that would otherwise get lost is now on-the-record and retrievable!</p>\n<p>Loom has this great new feature where you can one-click create an SOP based on the video, which is something I've been recommending to clients.</p>\n<p>It is a different way of working though and necessitates the cultivation of new habits.</p>\n<p>The very first step I would recommend to get going in the right direction is to choose a particular task where you have to do something repetitive, time box it to let's say 50 minutes, and then before you dive in hit the record button on Loom.</p>\n<p>At that point I found it's actually easier to focus because you have this feeling that somebody's watching you and if things go right they will watch you in the future because this video will enter your internal knowledge base or be communicated elsewhere.</p>\n<p>And then, too, if you accomplish the task and even get a few reps in by the end, you can turn that into a nugget of valuable know-how immediately available to be posted in your company knowledge base (or, short of something highly structured, just a open Slack channel that anybody can search when they come on board).</p>\n<p>Do you use Loom at work?

Important knowledge remains <em>locked in people's heads</em>, data quickly becomes stale, and it can take weeks of analysis to unearth key takeaways. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, strategic decisions are made based on an incomplete or outdated picture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AI-Powered Data Collection</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is where AI can be a game-changer. </p>\n\n<p>Using tools like AI-enhanced surveys (see: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/voiceform/\">Voiceform</a>), and automated phone interviews (e.g., via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/vapi-ai/\">Vapi</a>), companies can now collect significantly richer data from employees, especially customer-facing staff who have valuable frontline insights not captured in systems. </p>\n\n<p>For example, after receiving an email invitation to give an AI-powered phone line a call (at his or her convenience), a sales rep could verbally share observations from recent client meetings, which get automatically transcribed and analyzed for sentiment and themes. Product usage logs, e.g., from @mixpanel can be intelligently clustered to identify power users and key behaviors. Employee responses to open-ended survey questions can be semantically parsed to surface frequently mentioned issues and opportunities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rapid Insight Synthesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>The second way AI enhances strategic planning is by compressing the time needed to extract insights from raw data. With techniques like unsupervised learning, topic modeling, and summarization, AI engines can rapidly identify patterns and distill key takeaways from large, unstructured datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Short of that, you can just stuff the transcripts into a new chat with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropicresearch/\">Anthropic</a> </p>\n\n<p>Instead of an analyst spending days manually tagging and graphing survey responses, an AI system could automatically create a concise executive summary within minutes.

This allows decision-makers to incorporate much fresher, more comprehensive insights into strategic plans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Piloting the Approach</strong></p>\n\n<p>For companies interested in piloting an AI-enhanced strategic planning process, a reasonable timeline would be:</p>\n\n<p>- Month 1: Assess current planning practices, map key decisions, and identify insight gaps </p>\n\n<p>- Month 2: Design and implement AI-powered data collection mechanisms (surveys, interviews, etc)</p>\n\n<p>- Month 3: Conduct data collection in the lead up to quarterly/annual planning</p>\n\n<p>- Month 4: Use AI to synthesize insights and hold enhanced strategy sessions</p>\n\n<p>- Month 5+: Measure improvements in strategic plan quality, alignment and execution</p>\n\n<p>As with any new business process, it's important to start small, move quickly, and iterate based on feedback. But the potential upside is significant - richer insights driving clearer priorities and better decisions. That's an edge that every exec should be eager to harness.</p>\n\n<p>The rise of AI is creating compelling new opportunities to reimagine core business activities.

Customer interviews, research findings, meeting notes — AI helps compress these rich information sources into their actionable essence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Focus on the frontier:</strong> AI's data crunching power frees up human attention for what matters most — grappling with anomalies and exploring the unknown unknowns at the edge of imagination. The best strategies emerge from this creative frontier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Probe, learn, repeat:</strong> In an uncertain world, static plans are brittle. AI supercharges the process of probing reality, rapidly assimilating feedback, and iterating. Strategists can experiment more boldly, learn faster, and adapt with agility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Augment, don't automate:</strong> AI shines at filtering information and generating options. But humans remain uniquely capable of the judgment, empathy and creativity needed for great strategy. The winning combo is AI and human intelligence working in tandem.</p><hr><p>Some questions to ponder:</p>\n\n<p>- How much time does your team spend on rote information processing vs. creative strategy? </p>\n\n<p>- What experiments could you run if you had 10X more info at your fingertips?</p>\n\n<p>- Where is your organization's strategic frontier — and how will you explore it?</p>\n\n<p><em>One thing is clear</em>: AI is already a game-changer for strategy.

    "content": "<p>I think there's a lot of alpha be found in employing certain heuristics or frameworks, especially in corporate settings, that are either generally underrated or eschewing the ones that are overrated in favor of some orthogonal new approach.</p>\n<p>Often times, I think these sort of opportunities emerge because as certain arts become more mature, a precise technical jargon gets codified to support the transfer of what had been developed initially as a tacit body of knowledge.</p>\n<p>And ultimately, what can happen is that newcomers to the field end up mistaking in some sense the material or formal cause of the art for its final cause.</p>\n<p>Or in other situations, there may be some confusion about final cause, in which case the heuristic or approach may actually be underrated; people are likely to discount it because they don't realize that what's actually useful for is not necessarily what people assume it be used for.</p>\n<p>So all this is very abstract, but I'll give you two examples.</p>\n<p>One where think the heuristic is wildly underrated are personality assessments like DISC or StrengthsFinder. I often hear people denigrate these as being corporate horoscopes or roll their eyes and mention \"HR made me do this once\" or something to that.</p>\n<p>But what I find interesting about this is that that low rating or importance that they assign to that particular heuristic is actually signaled by the term horoscope which implies some degree of prediction in an overly complex system where the formal causal model is unlikely to be rooted sufficiently in reality.</p>\n<p>Now I would argue that that's not the point of these diagnostics. It's actually to start a conversation where individuals (working especially on a cross-functional team) can come to terms with one another and generate testable hypotheses that they can then put into practice regarding how to communicate effectively, what type of work should be delegated to whom under what circumstances, the potential conditions under which certain members of the team would get energized, etc.</p>\n<p>Psych research demonstrates that even fundamental personality traits can change over the course of one or more decades. So clearly, these aren't set in stone to the extent that they can be relied upon for highly precise predictions, but they can be and SF I think in particular, made useful for reducing complexity when it comes to interpersonal team dynamics to the point that testable hypotheses can be generated and acted upon.</p>\n<p>This ultimately leads, when used correctly, to higher performing cross-functional teams—but only through subsequent process, not the diagnostic per se!</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are all kinds of complicated and esoteric terms of art in management, whether that's management of projects, products or corporations as a whole...</p>\n<p>(Cont'd in comments...)</p>\n",

I'm headed to the Professional Services Council Acquisition conference today.</p>\n<p>Normally, I do some pretty rigorous research on speakers, other attendees, etc. But I'm a bit time pressed at the moment. So instead, on my morning walk, I opened up the conference app, scrolled through the attendee list, and some of the programming, and put on <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> voice in the background.</p>\n<p>As I had questions about what I was seeing, I would simply ask <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> voice, whether it was to tell me about a company, maybe some recent news, a particular attendee, or a speaker, and any interesting positions that they've taken on a topic — and it did a pretty good job with (from what I can tell are increasingly capable) web search to load salient data into the context window!</p>\n<p>Now, the information, of course, isn't as rich as if I had opened a bunch of different browser windows on my desktop machine and did my usual piping of YouTube transcripts, podcast episodes, etc. into tools like <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a>, <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a>, etc. Or use MultiOn to quickly peruse LinkedIn profiles, all in parallel.</p>\n<p>But it got the job done, and well enough that I feel like I have sufficient context to spark conversations with some folks I'd love to connect with at the event.</p>\n<p>What enables this is a new <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> feature that allows you to actually turn on voice in the background. So you don't have to be on the app, and you can browse around to different other applications.</p>\n<p>Soon, allegedly, you'll be able to share your screen as well, so it'll have the context of what you're looking at and can incorporate that into its responses. This is definitely a paradigm shift in terms of human-computer interaction.</p>\n<p>And if you want a taste of what's coming, I'd recommend experimenting with this particular pattern on your next walk break.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Every week, I practice what I preach and try to accelerate my consultancy's progress towards my highest-order goals with an AI-assisted OKR sync.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things I learned this week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital tools for not just remote but asynchronous communication and collaboration are getting better and better. I really believe if you're able to put constraints in place that force you to learn how to use them to solve problems for other people, it ends up being a major advantage because you're afforded many more degrees of freedom.</li>\n<li>For example, instead of automatically scheduling a call, I try to do as much discovery as I can upfront using AI tools to do deep research on a client or prospect, codify my analysis in a Figma  whiteboard, and then send a rich and comprehensive Loom  video with a call to action to take the next step. This could be scheduling a live call, talking to a voice agent who can ask the person specific questions, or even paying via a Stripe custom product link for a particular output or outcome that I propose. This has allowed me to align the hardest problems with the times of the day when my energy levels are highest.</li>\n<li>I'm continually surprised and fascinated by this liminal space between people and computers when it comes to delegation. As AI becomes more capable, hiring computers for a particular task rather than a person becomes a lot more sensible (eg MultiOn for information retrieval vs. or prior to hiring a freelance researcher.) However, there are cases where pure human labor is more reliable. This necessitates discernment when it comes to the what/when/how of \"who\" to delegate to, whether it's speed, quality, reliability, the amount of information that you're at liberty to share, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll continue to report back on what I learned but the bottom line is AI-powered humans that are distributed in space and time are a whole new category of workforce that I expect to emerge in interesting ways in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>Feel free to add questions in the comments.</p>\n<p>(I'll probably start publishing these updates on a more regular basis as I figure out what exactly it takes to ride the AI wave and build a business in a new way that the technology fundamentally enables.)</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>AI is starting to fundamentally change my relationship with time.</p>\n<p>Similar to how computers, as they go from number crunching word crunching machines, are transforming the \"how\" and \"what\" of knowledge work via an expanding scope of delegatable tasks, these new capabilities also allow us to approach the \"when\" of work in a qualitatively different way by making it possible to \"pull\" future outcomes into the present.</p>\n<p>Instead of waiting for something to happen (e.g., that meeting next week), one might instead prioritize what to focus on in the context of ambitious, uncertain, longer-term goals. With AI assistance, it's possible to reduce uncertainty toward a final cause by crunching previously impossible volumes of information during high-energy, deep work sessions (which can also have the effect of bringing a bit more clarity to formal causes).</p>\n<p>Once you've hit the limit of a time-boxed task, you can asynchronously tap into a liquid labor force, either through expert consults via voice agents or horizontally scalable task orders (eg for research and information retrieval) via platforms like Upwork by transforming the raw recordings you have on hand of salient contextual data and the recorded process (say, a Loom video) of you doing reps 1-10, providing enough specificity to guide successful task completion while also protecting sensitive info but running it all through a SOTA model like <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> first.</p>\n<p>This dovetails nicely with cultivating a habit of communicating via rich media (vs. email or text only). This approach, previously time-consuming for the recipient of a long-form, unpolished video can now be summarized with a personalized set of headlines beforehand or interacted with directly via the other party's AI intermediary.</p>\n<p>Constant experimentation with AI over the past year (towards the end of helping a diverse array of clients across industries accelerate toward their BHAGs) has taught me to continuously question whether I might be able to delegate that next task that needs to get done (and I more or less know how to do), but don't find particularly energizing to sufficiently (and increasingly) competent machines.</p>\n<p>As we continue to reorient the way we work with these new tools in hand, I anticipate we might be able to enter more fruitful relationship with time (and globally distributed collaborators) as well.</p>\n<p>Instead of being constrained by our calendars, waiting anxiously for our next back-to-back Zoom call, we can instead reduce pockets of uncertainty by tackling a queue of highly engaging, challenging, valuable chunks of work—and bring desired outcomes into our locus of control.</p>\n<p>(Screenshot from my OKR sync \"with\" <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> this morning — I record a monologue that follows the same process I run with clients and engage in a little AI-powered thought partnership post to help me make sense of what I've learned over the past week.)</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>You often hear the term \"responsible AI\" these days. It's often used in reference to issues like hallucination, bias, or killer robots. While they deserve attention, there are two things you should really consider now, if you want to use AI responsibly: privacy & security and expecting all employees to start acting like managers.</p>\n<p>Regarding privacy, here's an uncomfortable truth about the generative AI boom: as the models get more powerful, there's increasing incentive to record everything. I refer to this as \"digital manifest destiny.\" Unlike Google, where you type in short queries, to get quality outputs from large language models and their successors, you need to feed in high fidelity, raw recordings. These are currently captured through AI note takers and soon other means as \"ambient compute\" becomes more common.</p>\n<p>The norms are changing. You might now expect your remote conversations to be recorded through tools like Otter or Fireflies. But the responsibility of securing and managing this repository of digital memories is huge. Not only are you protecting your own secrets, but also those of others. The seriousness of this responsibility is seen in the severe penalties imposed on psychologists, priests, and lawyers if they reveal clients' secrets.</p>\n<p>To address this, consider upgrading your security. This means developing guidelines, policies, and a prudent approach to information access and compartmentalization. These can be bolstered by multi-factor authentication, biometric passkeys, coverage by Agency (they offer Crowdstrike to SMBs), and a meaty cybersecurity insurance policy.</p>\n<p>The second issue is that as you use AI, you take on the responsibilities of a manager — even if you're traditionally an individual contributor. By delegating tasks to an AI system and signing off on them, you're putting your reputation on the line, just like a manager would. As AI gets more powerful and more tasks can be delegated, the scope of your responsibilities and consequences of your decisions will likely grow. Therefore, it's essential to have quality assurance, quality control, and risk mitigation practices in place.</p>\n<p>This will be a difficult transition for many AI users. It's something that executives and team leaders should prepare for through employee training and upskilling.</p>\n<p>While there are no experts in AI, only pioneers, starting conversations about best practices and organizational policies is helpful. We can all make better decisions as individuals, managers, and participants in the AI-mediated economy.</p>\n<p>What are some other practices you'd recommend when considering practical approaches to responsible AI?</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Interesting study.</p>\n<p>I have three comments, based on my professional experience integrating Generative AI into production workflows from the level of the sole proprietorship all the way up to the enterprise over the past year+:</p>\n<p>First, even within the same function, I've observed consistently a power law distribution in terms of technology usage and value created. As a rule of thumb, one person amongst a peer group of 10 colleagues with similar responsibilities will account for 90% of the usage and also a similar percentage of value created. Most of that value is in cycle time reduction, which allows them to invest surplus time and attention into higher order activities that you couldn't have necessarily anticipated. While yes, you can make those user-led innovation–driven workflows powered by AI more accessible to their peers with streamlined user experiences and some custom software development, from what I can tell, the power law curve still applies, and I'd even go so far to speculate that in general the ceiling is rising faster than the floor. (The glib version of this comment would be, \"skill issue,\" although it's probably more accurate to describe the limiting factors as \"mindset\" and \"desire\" more specifically.)</p>\n<p>Applying this in aggregate, it's entirely possible that we might, at least in certain sectors, only see a marginal bump in GDP. However, at the levels of specific individuals and businesses, the differences could be quite extreme.</p>\n<p>Second, information technology and the internet in general dovetail with generative AI and so lower barriers to global labor market participation in ways beyond just space - including time, culture, language, and many other dynamics one might consider. This is likely to put downward pressure on white-collar wages in developed countries for existing, known tasks, especially since young, very online, AI powered autodidacts in, say, Subharan Africa, are more flexible on important things like \"business model,\" e.g., outcome-based compensation and fractional employment as the norm vs. the FTE expectation in the US.</p>\n<p>Third, the new jobs, unmet needs, problems, and capital configurations that will likely emerge as the technology becomes more capable and integrated into the broader global economy are not just unknown, but probably unknowable and even unimaginable.</p>\n<p>As individuals reclaim surplus time, attention, and energy, they'll discover new, compelling, and unexpected ways to utilize it, unlocking new economic opportunities, generating insights about our world, and broadening our access to both information space and reality itself.</p>\n<p>Although I am a fan of AI mythbusting (there is much hype that needs to be dispelled), I'm largely optimistic that everyone will have the opportunity to experience significant benefits. However, it's important to acknowledge that it's impossible to know, or even really speculate, how exactly this might unfold until the experiment has been conducted.</p>\n",

Normally, I send some minimal reflection material to participants and then go in cold. But a couple weeks ago, I included a phone number that was connected to a VAPI voice agent that was loaded up with a bunch of questions that were super specific and pertinent to some of the things that we had seen over the last three months.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the participants called the number, talked to it for 20 minutes, and that had two interesting benefits. One was I got a bunch of really high quality information that I could easily incorporate into the reflection the next day. And then two, it seemed to be helpful in preparing her by helping her think through some of the stuff that was on her mind that she wanted to bring up during the session.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>In regards to contractor vetting, because I work with folks internationally (and I'm happy to respect their privacy to some extent but also need to maintain a high degree of security), I have policies and systems that allow me to sufficiently compartmentalize information while tapping into global talent and delegating well scoped tasks or even larger projects. In lieu of a traditional background check then, I have a voice agent that the contractor can call into, which has a few different questions that I asked to gauge their trustworthiness, including some behavioral questions. And then I tailor it to each person. Because it's live, it's more difficult for somebody to lie or bluff their way through it, since I have a slight information advantage and I can interpret emotional cues in their voice when listening to the recording.</li>\n<li>And then for the micro consults: I've been looking for expertise and inputs when it comes to AI sales enablement tools. I offered a few experts a pro rated (per minute) payment at half their hourly rate to talk to this voice assistant that I've loaded up with some really specific questions and also gave it the leeway to be curious and ask probing or follow up questions, which works really well when it's powered in particular by Anthropic <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> 3 Opus. There's also an outcome-based payment, where I'll double compensation if I end up closing a prospect this week, with my pitch at least informed by that expertise I tapped into via the asynchronous interview.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, a huge design space has opened up, and I can't stress how much of an opportunity there is to rethink your processes with this new capability.</p>\n<p>Got some other ideas?

What would have to be true for your answer to be [20% higher]? And why wasn't it [20% lower]?</li>\n<li>\"The pre-mortem\": If [your company] fails to [achieve its mission], why would that have been the case?</li>\n<li>\"The Peter Thiel question\": What is one thing you know to be true about [your company/the industry] that few other people at [your company] would agree with you on?</li>\n<li>\"The battery question\": Over the past three months, can you think of a single time you felt most energized? And then a time you felt most drained?</li>\n<li>\"The surplus quantifier\": If I were to wave a magic wand and take all of the [energy-draining tasks] off your plate, and you could reinvest all that surplus time and attention into [energy-giving tasks], how would that feel? And, assuming I could snap my fingers and make this 100% a reality, today, what would be an offensive amount of money for me to ask for?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All, and especially the first three, inform strategy and direction-setting.

I can tease out insights faster.</p>\n<p>The pattern I usually follow is to ask <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> to give me a short summary and then share any specific bits he found particularly interesting, contrarian, or counterintuitive.</p>\n<p>If the recommendation was in the context of an email thread or a live conversation, I'll just copy and paste all that data in and ask why, given this additional context, the person who sent the video might have thought that it was worth watching, etc.</p>\n<p>There's just a whole lot more you can do with a more powerful model. And while it's not quite as fast as Summarize dot tech, I've found the quality to be worth the few extra clicks or taps.</p>\n",

So, I thought I would try to provide a bit of clarification.</p>\n<p>When I'm talking about \"thinking naked\" in the context of AI, I'm referring to a sort of paradox that I've encountered in using the technology more and more in interesting, different ways. Ultimately, the more, or I guess I should say \"more skillfully\", you use it, the less you actually use it.</p>\n<p>Literally, you spend more time thinking about or doing things with basically zero input from AI systems.</p>\n<p>I've also referred to this, to the mechanism by which you get to this point, as AI acting as an \"on-ramp to a frontier.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean a literal physical place per se, but rather some pocket of invisible information or knowledge space that the system has never encountered based on its training data. Here, you as an embodied person grounded in reality need to conduct experiments, try things, and then make sense of whatever happens more or less on your own.</p>\n<p>To put it simply, you're using AI as more of a filtering mechanism than a generative one whereby only the unresolved items that are most interesting and most important are quickly brought to your attention. Then, you need to really attend to them, which means really think hard about what the heck is actually going on and then what you should do about it.</p>\n<p>That \"thinking hard\" part is more or less what I mean by \"thinking naked\".</p>\n<p>You can certainly consult other folks in trying to make sense of whatever the anomalous data is, but you can't really get around the fact that you'll need to devote quite a bit of attention and work through it via your own natural faculties without machine assistance.</p>\n<p>It's sort of like getting really hard-hitting, critical thinking questions in a high-quality English literature class, but applied to everything you encounter professionally.</p>\n<p>I hope that helps.</p>\n",

You've basically delegated 90 plus percent of that task to a machine and done it in such a way that other people, your colleagues, and potentially folks outside of the company can use it.</p>\n<p>Now, on one hand, this is great, but on the other hand, it raises some really serious issues, especially for the employee, and I think it is in line with Ethan Mollick's \"secret cyborgs\" idea.</p>\n<p>Capital assets beget leverage, and leverage is what allows you to build a company and create and then capture outsized value.</p>\n<p>But standard employment contracts are generally cash or wage-based. And, of course, most corporations are not democratically governed, certainly not by employees.</p>\n<p>If employers become incentivized to completely surveil their employees, which is increasingly the case, because that data becomes raw material for AI systems to create capital assets, then employers and shareholders end up capturing the value, while employees, while potentially producing much, capture very little.</p>\n<p>And then, in the extreme, it could be the case that some sort of process, which would normally be stored in their head as latent knowledge, might be then considered work-for-hire, and an employee may not be able to take that knowledge to another company or start their own business.</p>\n<p>This seems crazy, but it looks like this is where we're headed.</p>\n<p>We need new mechanisms that enable more flexible corporate governance and free participation by expert contributors, because the standard contracts we have in place that govern employer and employee relationships are simply going to start breaking, or at least making less sense, in this new AI paradigm.</p>\n",

You see this already with <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> Plus versus <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Pro. They have distinct characters and strengths.</p>\n<p>I find myself switching between the two, depending on the nature of the task, as a function of my evolving intuition around which one is going to perform better, given what I’m trying to do.</p>\n<p>Now, I had a very interesting AI workshop session last week, where the team I was helping wanted to convert some of their video content into a blog post.</p>\n<p>And so we fed the inputs and the prompts to both <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Pro and GPT-4 Turbo. And while the team generally preferred the style and tone of <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a>'s output, the person who was responsible for creating the blog strongly preferred the content of GPT-4 Turbo’s output.</p>\n<p>We piped the output from GPT-4 Turbo into the conversation with <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a>, and simply said, “we like the content of this, but the style of the output that you produced.”</p>\n<p>The ultimate synthesis was significantly stronger than the original two outputs.</p>\n<p>That made me wonder if we’re already at a point of differentiation between the foundation models, where it actually might make sense as a general purpose approach to kick up requests, especially when you’re trying to do something new (where there’s a decent amount of uncertainty), to each of the foundation models, and then somehow convene them in such a way that there might be a process of synthesis and you get the best parts of each output.</p>\n<p>One can imagine there might be debate between foundation models, self-critiques, dialogue, etc., with a human overseeing the process.</p>\n<p>I think it’s not unlikely that this approach might yield better results than simply relying upon one foundation model and foundation model provider.</p>\n<p>This is more expensive, of course, but given the level of complexity and potential value of effectively solving the problem or completing the task, it could very much be worth it to do it this way.</p>\n<p>In the interest of imagining a potential solution, I guess it would be some kind of interface to your private data repository that acts as a facilitator and intermediary between the expert models, an orchestrator or almost like a chief-of-staff, that I could imagine might run locally on your phone or laptop or have access to your private repositories of information and then do some of the rote work of information retrieval, repackaging, routing, gathering of outputs, synthesizing, coordinating, etc.</p>\n<p>I’m going to think about this and experiment more, but would be quite curious if anybody else has thoughts or has experienced something like this — Dmitri, Ryan, Neil, and Jean especially!</p>\n",

Help me prepare.”</p>\n<p>Now <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> will go through the tons of information and suggest you tailored plans.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen 90-95% times, it gives pretty amazing results.</p>\n<p>Remember: Don’t expect magic. Expect nuggets of insights to help you think.</p>\n<p>Work with AI to design an effective conversation.</p>\n<p>Step 3) Iterate better with <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a></p>\n<p>Once done, paste the transcript from the call in the same <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> window.</p>\n<p>Then again ask claude an open-ended question:</p>\n<p>“This is how the meeting went. Can you tell me what I could have improved?”</p>\n<p>Make AI your trusted advisor.</p>\n<p>Working with it, you can significantly improve your speeds of iterations.</p>\n<p>That’s it!</p>\n<p>Keep following the process & you’ll see how you’ll become 10x more effective over time!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>**</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PS – We covered this during a live AI power hour a few weeks ago with Lapo Lazzati, Mike Newton & Nick Pope.</p>\n<p>Over a 60-minute call, we discussed applications of AI across a variety of domains.</p>\n<p>Here’s a video from the live session explaining the same concept 👇🏻</p>\n",

Select needs could be posted to a public \"micro-RFI/RFP feed,\" à la a Twitter/X account.</p>\n<p>Private citizens could respond directly—unmediated by complicated contracting vehicles—and make fractional contributions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as American workers generate publicly available information (or \"digital exhaust,\" e.g., public GitHub commit histories, long-form podcast interviews on YouTube) per participation in the remote workforce, that information could be incorporated into a qualification process—whereby the raw material is first mined by AI—that makes matching citizens to opportunities more effective.</p>\n<p>This begs two additional questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How could we keep sensitive information safe? And</li>\n<li>How might we take right-sized steps towards this broader vision?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In re 1, I think the ultimate answer is to give citizens the choice to opt into a background check system that leverages privacy-preserving technology and works continuously to mine their private data—kept in a \"data escrow\" built with auditable OSS—with an AI-powered fine-toothed comb, only bringing issues to the attention of investigators as needed. Ideally, this would flag small issues early, allowing for course corrections that preclude the types of errors that can slip through the cracks with traditional vetting processes that execute checks with much less frequency.</p>\n<p>In re 2, to test my hypothesis, I would take the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Convene a cross-functional team with the objective of, over the course of 6 months reducing time-to-resolution of an agency problem, whereby a private citizen fulfills the need and is compensated, from months to days.</li>\n<li>Create a blueprint of existing processes, e.g., hiring & onboarding, and prioritize incremental improvements with AI integration, whereby a growing portion of clerical and administrative trivia can be delegated to machines, making the overall flow of talent more efficient.</li>\n<li>Continuously measure the results of small-scale experiments and course-correct on a weekly basis until the objective has been achieved.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "content": "<p>Get 50% of Your Time Back with AI: A Practical Framework for Business Leaders</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to present alongside Ryan Markman to a group of elite fractional CMOs (thanks, Rajat Kapur and &Marketing!), sharing insights I’ve gained working with AI over the past year.</p>\n<p>In my portion of the presentation, I laid out a practical framework for business leaders looking to install that \"first AI outlet\" in their organizations.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that done right, integrating AI into workflows and processes gives knowledge workers back 50% of their time. However, most companies flounder trying to figure out exactly how and where to implement AI capabilities.</p>\n<p>My 3-level model offers guidance:</p>\n<p>✅ Eager Assistant: Delegate rote information retrieval, documentation and other tedious tasks to AI. This is contingent on you knowing the goals.</p>\n<p>🧠 Thought Partner: If goals aren't clearly defined, use conversational AI to provide clarity on objectives and strategy.</p>\n<p>⚡️ Electricity: Take an \"AI-native\" approach where it's embedded in everything. Build custom workflows and software to save more time.</p>\n<p>Where should you start? Identify irksome tasks people have to do but don't enjoy. Find bottlenecks holding back core processes. Empower a champion user to demonstrate major productivity gains. Prove AI can deliver over 90% time savings.</p>\n<p>The key is iterating quickly at first. You don't need huge teams or long development cycles. Over time the capabilities compound, more users see the benefits and adopt the tools. Eventually your workforce hits the \"screaming pain\" point if AI is taken away.</p>\n<p>This practical approach allows AI to enhance human potential rather than replace jobs. The time savings let people focus on satisfying, high-leverage activities. Overall organization agility and responsiveness increase dramatically.</p>\n<p>I explain the framework in more detail in the accompanying video clip. Check it out and let me know your thoughts!</p>\n<p>Are you looking to install some \"AI outlets\" in your company?</p>\n<p>Send me a DM, and I’d be happy to provide guidance.</p>\n",

    "title": "ChatGPT is NOT Google: Here's How to Actually Use AI for Search",
    "date": "2023-12-20",
    "content": " <p>One of the biggest myths I'm quick to dispel when using AI is that <em>it's just like Google</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional internet search is often the model that somebody applies during their first encounter with ChatGPT because we've become used to using Google as our primary gateway to the internet over the last 20 years. The application interface looks quite similar: a text input box that would invite a short sequence of space-delimited keywords.</p>\n\n<p>However, you will have a disappointing experience if you treat tools like ChatGPT this way. You want to invert Google Search's best practices:&nbsp;<strong>more is more</strong>. The more personal, precise, and voluminous context you can provide—especially in the context of a particular goal—the more valuable the initial output and subsequent interactions will be.</p>\n\n<p>And, now that tools like ChatGPT and Claude have context windows of greater than 100,000 tokens in length (roughly equivalent to 10 or more hours of live spoken dialogue), they can become significantly more helpful when you arm them with relevant contextual data, sort of like onboarding a fractional expert with a massive onboarding document (except it's transmitted immediately).</p>\n\n<p>All that said, while ChatGPT can't and likely won't replace traditional document-based internet search, there are interesting ways to use these AI tools to accomplish search tasks per se—but not in the rote information retrieval sense. Think of this type of search as, instead, venturing out into a physical area you've never been before, a dimly lit part of the map a few hours' detour from the well-trodden area where you've been doing your knowledge work.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, what does this mean? Instead of searching for individual documents like you would with Google, I find it helpful to search for&nbsp;<em>individual thinkers</em>&nbsp;who have produced knowledge adjacent to the problem space in which I'm operating.</p>\n\n<p>A practical way to do this is to work with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_yesterday-my-client-asked-me-how-the-activity-7137440507265261568-ZZG9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">AI as a thought partner</a>, and once you've reached a point where you need help figuring out where to go next, you ask ChatGPT or Claude to imagine that it was a group dinner host. Direct it to invite five other credible (but extremely esoteric!) thinkers to discuss this very topic you're trying to make sense of at a private, off-the-record dinner where everyone could speak at length, challenge each other, and overall try to work with you in this problem space.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend pushing the AI system to find the most esoteric thinkers it can because, initially, it will shortlist guests with more mainstream ideas. That's all well and good—and perhaps good enough, depending on your level of familiarity with this particular topic—but what's likely to be better is discovering someone with pertinent, original ideas that are underrated or undervalued in mainstream discourse because they have not received much attention (yet!).</p>\n\n<p>At this point, you may seek out the seminal primary source documents they have produced (a Google Scholar search ranked by impact score or date may do the trick) and spend a little time chewing on those in the context of your problem. At that point, you're moving entirely outside the AI system, researching, reading, and \"<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_although-i-am-a-technophile-more-recently-activity-7113211460083691520-AFt_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">thinking naked</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, before doing that, if you want to try to make the most of the exercise, you can ask the AI system to model a vigorous debate between all the different simulated attendees by starting with the question, \"What is one thing that you know to be true that everybody else at the table would disagree with you on?\" (AKA the famous Peter Thiel question from&nbsp;<em>Zero to One</em>).</p>\n\n<p>What's valuable about this optional exercise is that it helps you grasp the diverse perspectives (and the gaps between them) that you and your dinner guests hold on the matter at hand). This context is valuable in understanding their primary source materials before delving deeper into their positions.</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, it's essential to understand that AI systems do not work like Google's search engine, which retrieves individual documents. However, they can be used to perform&nbsp;<em>a specific type of complementary search</em>&nbsp;that may help you know where to look for primary source documents. These documents can then be retrieved, analyzed, and made useful.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, I recommend experimenting with AI systems to solve new problems and explore areas on the map of abstract information space (or \"latent space\" in AI terms) you haven't been before, starting with a simulated private dinner with esoteric thinkers who might make serendipitous contributions to your train of thought. Please keep an open mind when using these tools, understanding that you shouldn't expect to use them as a substitute for traditional search (or other media) but as complements or supplements.</p>\n\n<p>At best, you might discover new ways of interacting with information that helps you accelerate progress toward your goals. And that's how innovation happens.</p> ",

    "title": "Go Forth and Click No More: How we can move beyond the awkwardness of chatbots and screen-based AI interactions",
    "date": "2023-11-16",
    "content": " <p>One of the big problems with current AI/chat applications is that although it would seem at first glance that this would be a preferable alternative to the traditional point-and-click component-based interface because of the additional personalization and flexibility afforded to users, the truth is it actually, more often than not, introduces additional friction. This is one reason why I think, in general, the turn-your-website-into-a-chatbot approach just does not make a whole lot of sense.</p>\n\n<p>If you think about this from an ergonomics perspective, or I guess human-computer interaction more specifically, every key press, and most people still are typing, which is unfortunate because moving to dictation, especially since we have state-of-the-art models like Whisper, is just so much better once you've made the switch. But each key press to provide some kind of input probably is more cognitively taxing than a mouse click. So there's a relatively high cost in terms of cognitive load and energy from a user perspective when they're presented with a text box, let's say, versus a point-and-click interface.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is that it's open-ended, and most of the experiences I've seen require the user to initiate the conversation. And even with a few conversation starters as little components, it's just not a particularly good experience. It's like if you met somebody at a networking event, and you knew maybe a little bit about them, but they were just kind of standing in front of you, drink in hand, intensely staring at you silently, waiting for you to initiate the conversation. Like, nobody actually wants that kind of experience.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, what we'd prefer is to have somebody who knows quite a bit about us, can meet us where we are, has an understanding of our preferences, and instead of requiring us to do the hard work of figuring out how to initiate the conversation under conditions of pretty extreme uncertainty, it would be best if they actually initiated the conversation and asked us questions that got us energized because they touched directly on exactly the topics that we're interested in.</p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://x.com/curious_vii/status/1715188843211636952?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">I've written about this before</a>, but I think ultimately there are two pretty substantial personal computing shifts that need to happen for us to be able to go beyond these issues.</p>\n\n<p>The first is there needs to be some kind of login with your digital memories experience whereby you share some portion of your private digital repository, which could be maybe your emails or your search history, which of course Google has and is part of the reason why they're a trillion-dollar company. Or in the extreme, some subset of everything you've seen, said, heard, done, and so on and so forth, which will be increasingly feasible with always-on ambient computing platforms (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/humaneinc/\" target=\"_blank\">Humane™</a>'s new Pin) that are coming to market in the months and years ahead.</p>\n\n<p>The second issue is that screen-based interfaces are, I think, never really going to be a perfect fit for this kind of discursive experience. And really for it to work, we've got to be able, willing, and desire a more radical switch to primarily voice interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Now, that's great when it comes to input because it's actually significantly less cognitively taxing to speak at length than it is to type. And I would argue probably even to point and click because you can be almost purely in a production mode and not distracted by whatever's on the screen in front of you.</p>\n\n<p>So that's great. But on the flip side, when it comes to consumption of information, primarily through an audio interface, meaning text-to-speech or something spoken, the threshold in terms of overall intelligence and reliability of pertinent, relevant, useful, and interesting responses from the AI assistant counterparty is extremely high.</p>\n\n<p>And although I'm pretty impressed by what's already possible with assistants like <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/inflectionai/\" target=\"_blank\">Inflection AI</a>'s Pi that ask you questions by default, which I think is an absolutely brilliant user experience choice, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a>'s nascent voice-only interface through the ChatGPT app, my suspicion is that getting to the point that people are en masse willing to make that switch to a voice-first medium when it comes to using networked personal computers is going to be quite, quite high.</p>\n\n<p>And we may end up running into a series of technical problems that delay the adoption of this technology and prevent it from having to be integrated into our lives in a way that really unlocks unprecedented productivity, similar to how it's taken much longer for self-driving cars to reach the level of reliability that consumers and regulators expect.</p>\n\n<p>Or, in the case of spatial computing or virtual reality technology, the user experience thresholds around things like latency, which has to be super, super short to prevent cybersickness, or the incredibly high resolution screens that we need, spatial audio requirements, device weight, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So basically, what I'm saying is, I think it's difficult, but certainly not impossible, especially in highly specific and tailored use cases, to leverage AI in a way that really improves workflow experiences, especially for knowledge workers who are encumbered by clerical and administrative tasks, and primarily use a point-and-click keyboard and mouse-based, screen-based personal computing environment.</p>\n\n<p>But I think for us to really take things to the next level, there has to be this more radical shift to a voice-first interface. And again, for the reasons that I described above, and also because on the consumption side, bandwidth is much higher when you're reading text, especially if you're hopping and skipping across documents, versus having to listen very intently to a voice assistant. The relative quality of what's compressed into every single word that you would listen to versus what you could skim over as you're browsing the web or your private document store is extremely, extremely high.</p>\n\n<p>And these are all challenges that I think will be overcome, but it really, you know, if we're to learn from virtual reality or self-driving cars, it could be significantly longer to squeeze out those last few percentage points of reliability and quality before this revolutionary technology really starts to making a meaningful impact.</p>\n\n<p>We shall see.</p> ",

Going deeper into reality is one of our deepest human desires, and once you've had the opportunity to explore it for yourself, those quotidian vices and cheap imitations lose their luster.</p>\n\n<p>That said, if there's one thing you take away from my posts on LinkedIn and elsewhere over the past year as I've tried to make sense of everything I've experienced on the AI frontier, it's an invitation to really consider the following question:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>When AI affords you the ability to become 2–20x as efficient and digital media becomes more immersive, discursive, and personal, what are you going to do with all that extra time?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7067540363019784193?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7067540363019784193%29\" target=\"_blank\">Something to really think about</a> as we reach the close of 2023 and look forward to things getting even more interesting in 2024...</p> ",

    "content": "<p>What does the long-term AI-human worker relationship look like?</p>\n<p>Hard to know exactly, but I am sure of one thing: the future of knowledge work is going very different than the past.</p>\n<p>Here's the million-dollar question for managers and specialists: Once AI can do knowledge work on par with the median person, how does one decide when to kick up a task to a human expert?</p>\n<p>Here's what got me thinking about this...</p>\n<p>Personally, as I've come to experiment more frequently with Anthropic's <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a>-as-sales-coach, it seems likely to me that more services will be brought \"in-house.</p>\n<p>This would dovetail nicely with an uptick in \"solopreneurship\" (and the emergence of global liquid labor markets where contractors flit between projects for a wide variety of clients as white collar workers are shed by leaner, more muscular, AI-powered enterprises facing cost pressures for the first time in a generation due to sustained elevated interest rates will increasingly need to retool and reenter the workforce) since support functions, from rote administration all the way to specializations like sales coaching, can be reliably delegated to machines.</p>\n<p>And while, yes, a great sales coach has <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> beat on most dimensions, it's hard to compete on speed and cost — $20 a month for <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> Pro and two minutes to copy-and-paste meeting transcripts later, I had B- to B+ actionable takeaways and a nice back-and-forth that gave me a bit more self-awareness.</p>\n<p>Compare that to working with a human coach, which could take weeks if not months to get value, is $100s to $1000s of dollars, lacks the degree of context <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> does (they're not going to review hours of tape), and isn't necessarily of good quality — very difficult to know if someone's going to be good or not without a word-of-mouth introduction from someone who knows both parties well, at least for now.</p>\n<p>So - how would the escalation mechanics actually work when going from AI to human? And how is it even going to be possible to transfer sufficient context? People are bottlenecked in re information consumption to a much greater degree than machines, so the human will never \"know\" as much as the AI surrogate, meaning the nature of the tasks they tackle will have to be fundamentally different.</p>\n<p>Will experts be forced to operate at higher levels of complexity to stay competitive? Will a career track look more like an ascent through degrees of competence and breadth via orchestration of AI agents versus the traditional (in some industries) focus on depth? Is it possible that it's somehow both?</p>\n<p>Strange times ahead as we deal with this emergent complexity! And possibly soon if AGI really does arrive before the end of the decade!</p>\n",

Will there be any opportunities left for enterprise software startups to capture value around AI?</p>\n<p>There’s still a lot to figure out in regards to permissioning and access, especially as labor markets become more liquid and enterprises decide whether to hitch their wagons to a single foundation model or myriad (including private OSS variants).</p>\n<p>For example, if a contractor is brought on board for a short-term project, they should be able to converse with the company’s data or AI system. This would allow them to get pertinent information that helps them achieve a result without much mediation by human managers.</p>\n<p>At the same time, of course, it would be imprudent to give them access to everything. So, figuring out how to strike the right balance in a generalizable way is, I think, going to be a pretty gnarly problem.</p>\n<p>And I would bet that there are commercial opportunities to help enterprises, large and small, navigate that liminal space.

    "content": "<p>“CMOs are being told, ‘You have to accomplish more with less.’ But, personalization and quality content require major time and effort…that's when it makes sense to take AI seriously.”</p>\n<p>Lindsey Scheftic is the former CMO of Ring (and an Apple & Red Bull alumna). We recently spoke about the challenges marketing executives face in 2023 and whether AI can help.</p>\n<p>I've been working with AI since I was at MIT and came armed with plenty of questions.</p>\n<p>Here are 3 key takeaways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CMOs are now expected to do more with less.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>CMOs are under serious pressure. They're expected to publish more content AND raise the bar on campaign performance. At the same time, budgets are being slashed.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, marketers can use AI to deliver higher-quality, personalized content that strengthens customer relationships.</p>\n<p>Teams can also use AI to get more actionable insights from campaign data, faster—but only if they're given the right tools and adequate training.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Marketers know that AI is important; but, they’re behind on training and adoption.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Per a recent survey by the Marketing AI Institute, 64% of marketers see AI as “crucial for success,” but 78% admit they “lack adequate training.”</p>\n<p>With so much noise around AI, it's difficult for CMOs to know where to invest their team’s scarce attention.</p>\n<p>In my experience integrating AI into >20 businesses, for an initiative to pay off, the technology needs to fit comfortably into existing workflows. The devil is in the details.</p>\n<p>For a cross-functional marketing team, those details will vary across Operations, Creative, Production, Strategy, Customer Research, and Acquisition.</p>\n<p>No wonder a team-wide AI initiative can seem impossibly complex.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>For long-term success, don’t be afraid to start small.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In her last CMO role, Lindsey found early traction through an AI pilot. She helped analysts quickly analyze a massive dataset of interview transcripts. They used custom tooling to rapidly surface insights, faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>This initial demonstration made it clear, even to the most conservative marketers, that AI could be made immediately useful. That quick win built confidence and fueled additional interest.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for you?</p>\n<p>Marketers already have to deal with a sky-high MarTech stack; the idea of taking on yet another tool can feel overwhelming.</p>\n<p>That’s why I’m teaming up with Lindsey to make AI adoption dead simple with personalized, results-driven AI workshops for CMOs, senior marketing, and media and advertising leadership.</p>\n<p>We’re combining my experience building generative AI solutions for clients across industries (from defense to healthcare services to private equity) with her unparalleled experience as a marketing leader and pioneer.</p>\n<p>If you’re a CMO who’s curious about AI and would like to understand how you can help your team do more, better, faster, via a personalized, no-nonsense private working session, reach out!</p>\n",

It was great exchanging perspectives with her, Rod Lacey, and Matt Johnson.</p>\n<p>Some key takeaways for executives leading their organizations through periods of rapid change:</p>\n<p>🔢 Instead of overwhelming employees with data, AI can act as a \"smart indexing tool\" to help leaders grasp what matters most.</p>\n<p>🤝 Rather than automating tasks people enjoy, AI should complement human skills and energies. The goal is to lift burdens, not compete.</p>\n<p>⏱️ Organizations shouldn't wait for the mythical \"perfect moment\" to understand employee motivations. Assess constantly with confidential pulse surveys.</p>\n<p>🗺️ To drive rapid change, identify \"pioneers\" who get a thrill from trailblazing vs trying to convince the skeptics.</p>\n<p>✍️ Leaders shouldn't just communicate the \"what\", but the \"why\" of change repeatedly. Help employees write their own chapter in the story.</p>\n<p>I hope viewers left feeling optimistic about leading change when combining emerging technologies like AI with human-centric leadership.</p>\n<p>Kudos again to Nicole for assembling a diverse panel to explore this complex topic.</p>\n<p>Please reach out if you would like to continue the discussion!</p>\n",

(It’s that liminal online/offline space in between the ends of a barbell-shaped relationship with digital media that cognition gets mixed up.) I would counsel other AI enthusiasts to consider taking a disciplined approach to going tech-less: front-loading workdays with unmediated contemplation.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Well, there are, broadly, two modes of knowledge work: that which generates experimental data and that which makes sense of it (which then precedes another round of contact with reality, segued via hypothesis generation—and so on). This is all towards the end of knowledge production—and, when we're especially fortunate, meaning-making. Those heuristics one discovers to work with a degree of reliability in his or her quest to move a particular project forward are the source of differentiated leverage (and, for commercial purposes, profit); if this technē can also be made generally useful as a capital and/or public good, it helps us all move THE project forward by catalyzing other seekers as they respectively drive toward—in machine learning terms—“compression progress.”</p>\n<p>My personal experience would lead me to believe that dedicating time before noon to thinking, simply, sometimes for hours before uttering a single word (though occasionally supported by committing a subset of these thoughts to “short-term memory” in slow longhand, e.g., attached) is an essential complement to those AI-as-rocket-fuel hyper-divergent/convergent excursions through latent space.</p>\n<p>Going without said time for too long inevitably leads to cognitive fragmentation and some variation of \"TikTok brain\"; no one wants this.</p>\n<p>About two weeks ago, I broke a cardinal rule: “Do not check your email (let alone Twitter!) until 1pm. This became a habit, and I allowed my precious morning attention to be swallowed by a queue of digital trivia.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until today, just after sunrise in the quiet car of the Amtrak to Penn Station, that I was able to bring order to the various data spread across clients, industries, and disparate domains that had accumulated at the periphery of my mind’s eye.</p>\n<p>Those first fifteen minutes of raw boredom—that paradoxical sensation of over- and under-stimulation—were, as they always are, uncomfortable; but, insights  emerged (as they always do), and in stark contrast to the brief thrill (and flood of cortisol) that comes with diving into my email queue, I am sated; I have no regrets.</p>\n<p>In the long-term, I hope that AI becomes nigh-invisible, and we can usher in a long-prophesied “calm computing” paradigm; until then, here’s a friendly PSA: remember to periodically remove the exocortex, be bored, and think for yourself.</p>\n",

As new foundation models come online, their capabilities are distributed almost instantaneously, meaning the cycle time between breakthrough and implementation CAN be unprecedentedly short.</p>\n<p>Why It Matters: Committing to a particular technology is likely not a sound strategic decision, as something better is likely to come online soon (and probably sooner than you think).</p>\n<p>2️⃣ AI is a Means to a Real-World End</p>\n<p>What It Means: For implementations to succeed, consultants should focus on what the client is seeking to achieve with AI, and then run quick, iterative experiments to assess technical feasibility without getting lost in the technical weeds.</p>\n<p>Why It Matters: The better the technology works, the more invisible it becomes. Staying focused on the end goal mitigates the risk of getting sidetracked by shiny AI toys (and premature optimization rabbit holes) and ensures better results for all parties—in both the short- and the long-run.</p>\n<p>3️⃣ No Experts, Only Pioneers</p>\n<p>What It Means: Expertise in AI is more about a process of continuous learning and experimentation than having a set of fixed knowledge.</p>\n<p>Why It Matters: Setting realistic expectations is crucial (there will be bugs!), but there’s also the exciting possibility of uncovering unexpected, groundbreaking capabilities during the engagement.</p>\n<p>4️⃣ Cut Through the Hype</p>\n<p>What It Means: While chatbots are often touted as the future, customer-facing chatbot technology, even with the latest LLMs, still leaves a lot to be desired; this is true of other \"sexy\" AI use cases that get a lot of attention in the media.</p>\n<p>Why It Matters: Focusing on unsexy but effective internal workflow automation and business operations is a pragmatic approach that can deliver robust, immediate value.</p>\n<p>5️⃣ Workflow Integration</p>\n<p>What It Means: Changing someone’s workflow is a big ask. Meeting users where they are before asking them to make a significant change (or even a seeming insignificant one, like opening a new window) is essential.</p>\n<p>Why It Matters: Making AI accessible within existing workflows (like Slack or Teams) can significantly ease the transition and increase adoption. Great tip, Karl Yeh !</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed my conversation with Karl and look forward to sharing more insights that emerge from our future conversations, as well as those with other practitioners in the space, as we all experiment and learn together in real time on the #AI frontier.</p>\n",

By relentlessly leveraging AI and coding tools like GPT-4 and GitHub <a href=\"https://copilot.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Copilot</a>, I delivered the desired outcome faster than either of us frankly thought would have been possible (and definitely wouldn't have been without AI).</p>\n<p>Even more powerful has been using this approach to create \"artisanal software\" for another client.</p>\n<p>Each week, I work live with a master operator at the company I'm serving to discover a problem in their workflow, design and build a solution, and ship it to production on the very same day.</p>\n<p>We recently achieved this entire end-to-end innovation cycle in less than 60 minutes - discovering, designing, developing and deploying a completely customized web application feature, a process that in my decade of product experience would have taken weeks and a cross-functional team even just a few months ago.</p>\n<p>Why does this work?</p>\n<p>Ambitious goals force you to deeply examine what would need to be true to achieve them. Extreme constraints leave no choice but to try creative new techniques. The combination drives breakthrough re-architectures.</p>\n<p>The key is maintaining a \"hypergrowth mindset\" - lofty goals to push your limits, plus humility to learn from AI, even in areas where you're an expert. While you're in the zone, look for 10x contributions aligned to business objectives; delegate rote tasks to machines.</p>\n<p>This compounding approach has transformed how I innovate with AI. I believe it can unlock new levels of transformational value for any leader or organization.</p>\n<p>As you explore the potential of AI, try setting more ambitious targets under tighter constraints.</p>\n<p>The breakthroughs may surprise you!</p>\n<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts on this technique - please like/comment!</p>\n<p>And thanks to Don Campbell for the thought-provoking discussion.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>“People are able to earn; people are able to learn. You can do everything there [on Twitter].”</p>\n<p>I recently had a fascinating conversation with GEORGE WANDHE, a Kenyan software engineer and CS student whose story is an illustrative example of how IT (and AI in particular) is reshaping traditional career pathways.</p>\n<p>What sets George apart is his ability to harness the power of platforms like Replit to secure paid programming gigs, build a portfolio, and accelerate his education in new, specialized fields like AI and backend Python development — and inspire his classmates to do the same.</p>\n<p>🛠️ The Role of Replit and Bounty Systems</p>\n<p>Instead of traditional summer internships, George started by taking on small bounties on Replit. Over time, he demonstrated his credibility and reliability. Replit gave him the dual advantage of offering the tooling required to complete tasks and connecting him to economic opportunities through their bounty system. The platform became a meritocratic space where he could showcase his skills, independent of factors like educational background and location.</p>\n<p>🐦 Twitter (now X) as a Multipurpose Tool</p>\n<p>George also leverages Twitter, not just as a space for networking and business opportunities but also as a source of practical knowledge. Through intentional curation, he gains access to a wealth of educational content from AI practitioners globally, propelling both his learning and earning capacities. It’s easy to dunk on Twitter (and social media more broadly) as a source of distraction and/or disinformation; George’s experience shows that, with the right perspective and intentions, it can unlock economic and educational opportunities.</p>\n<p>🤖 The Role of AI Tooling</p>\n<p>Integrated AI tools like Replit’s Ghostwriter and <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> Plus further supercharge learning for engineers like George. These tools serve as a “personalized tutors,” helping practitioners make sense of complex knowledge bases, new APIs, and more — ”AI-as-thought-partner” ultimately allows individuals to connect mind and hand more robustly, across a wider range of problems.</p>\n<p>🌍 The Implications</p>\n<p>George’s experiences represent what I perceive as a forthcoming seismic shift in how we should think about employment, education, and economic mobility:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A trend toward more fluid, global labor markets.</li>\n<li>A shift from traditional education pathways to more specialized, real-world experiences.</li>\n<li>The role of AI as a personal thought partner and workforce multiplier.</li>\n<li>The changing dynamics of employment, moving from full-time roles to a more “liquid workforce.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the longer term, we might see “liquid teams” come together to solve specific problems, compensated according to real-world results, rather than time invested (or outputs, for that matter).</p>\n<p>As we ponder the future of work, George's story offers us a compelling glimpse of what's possible at the intersection of AI and this new generation of digital natives, able to work from anywhere.</p>\n",

    "date": "2023-08-04",
    "content": "<p>🔮💼🧠 Where can you start integrating AI into your work to unlock more energy, productivity, and satisfaction?</p>\n<p>I've developed a simple heuristic to answer this question. It involves a journey back through your calendar and a deep dive into your to-do list. The aim? To identify the activities that give you energy and those that drain it from you. Imagine spending 80% of your work week doing what you love while delegating the rest to AI! 🚀</p>\n<p>So, how does it work? 🤔</p>\n<p>1️⃣ Take a trip through your calendar from the past 1-4 weeks. Identify events that left you feeling energized and vitalized. These are tasks you don't want to delegate. Now imagine doing more of them.</p>\n<p>2️⃣ Next, identify the events that left you feeling drained. These are ideal candidates for delegation to AI. With the right tools, you can automate up to 80% of these tasks.</p>\n<p>3️⃣ Finally, identify the tasks that consistently fall to number two on your to-do list. You know the ones I mean - necessary but not particularly rewarding tasks. These too are ripe for AI automation.</p>\n<p>This process opens the door to a virtuous cycle. By delegating the draining tasks to AI, you free up resources to focus on the tasks that give you energy. Over time, this leads to increased productivity, satisfaction, and a lot more of your time back! ⏳</p>\n<p>I've encapsulated this process into a handy <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> applet. This AI coach will guide you through this self-discovery journey and help you identify where you can integrate AI into your workflows. The outcome? More time and energy to do the things that truly matter to you.</p>\n<p>Give it a try! You might surprise yourself with the insights you gain. And once you've taken this journey, why not share a summary of what you learned as a comment on this post?</p>\n<p>👉 <a href=\"https://lnkd.in/dRxA4qrG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lnkd.in/dRxA4qrG</a></p>\n<p>Here's to becoming not just more productive, but happier and more satisfied at work! 🥂</p>\n<p>#AIIntegration #Productivity #WorkSatisfaction #<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> #AI</p>\n",

The contrast and potential harmony between these trajectories could redefine our relationship with AI, altering how we think, work, and create.</p>\n<p>Details: AI is descending Plato’s Pyramid, becoming more probabilistic and adaptive, resembling early stages of human cognition. This trend points to a future where AI handles tasks traditionally requiring human-like flexibility, freeing us for more complex cognitive endeavors.</p>\n<p>Relevance: For businesses and individuals, this progression suggests AI could become an even more integral part of our cognitive processes. AI tools could aid in making sense of complex systems, facilitating decision-making, and fueling creativity. The challenge lies in ensuring alignment with human values and maintaining transparency in AI decision-making.</p>\n<p>Relevant Quote: “Looking forward, it’s possible we might see the progression of both humans and AI toward a point of integration, where AI evolves to complement and augment human intelligence across the spectrum of cognitive tasks.” – <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a></p>\n<p>Critical Thinking Question: If we extend Plato’s Pyramid of Thought beyond the traditional four levels, into a future of integrated human and AI cognition, what ethical, societal, and technological challenges might we face, and how can we prepare for them?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lnkd.in/eFmcyu_s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lnkd.in/eFmcyu_s</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Is there room for a new ”I” in the trust equation?</p>\n<p>Here's why we shouldn't JUST focus on Intimacy; \"Interestingness\" can help build trust, too. Let's discover how pursuing unique interests can amplify your trustworthiness.</p>\n<p>The trust equation: Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation is a widely accepted concept, especially in the professional sphere. But what if we replaced \"Intimacy\" with \"Interestingness\"?</p>\n<p>While \"Intimacy\" can feel nebulous in a business context, \"Interestingness\"—defined as nurturing a unique, reality-anchored perspective—is something even people who aren't \"people people\" can actively cultivate.</p>\n<p>It's tempting to mistakenly equate being \"interesting\" with adopting a contrarian stance, but I propose a different approach. Cultivating interestingness involves self-discovery, understanding our intrinsic motivations, and using them to traverse unexplored territory on the frontier of human knowledge and experience.</p>\n<p>There, we may unearth pockets of insight where conventional heuristics fail, offering unique perspectives that others value. Ultimately, adopting a contrarian stance would only be an accidental consequence of making a tremendous discovery.</p>\n<p>This journey makes us not just interesting but also trustworthy. Our unique insights become valuable, we become more credible, and our intrinsic motivation creates an authenticity that enhances intimacy.</p>\n<p>To become more trustworthy, ask yourself, “What totally fascinates me?” and pursue it. Discover and seek to answer questions no one has ever asked; keep moving forward, relentlessly.</p>\n<p>I suspect that \"Interestingness\" might correlate with lower self-orientation. Someone with the freedom and the intrinsic motivation to venture along their unique path is less likely to be primarily driven by mimetic competition for limited resources like money or status; they are led instead by curiosity.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, supplementing \"Intimacy\" with \"Interestingness\" in the trust equation is an actionable idea that can help you become more trustworthy: Investing some of your invaluable attention each week (à la Google's 20% time) into hyper-individuated exploration, experimentation, and discovery for its own sake.</p>\n<p>What do you think?

It always took advertisers' and the platforms' objectives into account, often as the primary drivers of index design.</p>\n<p>Now, it looks like we'll be paying for what we consume when it comes to AI, which means we'll be adding \"AI\" to our monthly utility expenditures along with gas and electricity. This is ultimately good: We won't have to worry (at least not as much) that our \"machine-generated indices\" are working more in the interest of a third-party's rather than our own.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, this means that unifying narratives (interpretations of events) will likely fragment further, and reasoning errors are likely to compound as some people choose to prefer indices that reinforce their beliefs, rather than test hypotheses in the interest of achieving real-world results.</p>\n<p>That said, I remain extremely optimistic about the upside of this unprecedented power to process, prioritize, and present information straight from the source, especially for the next generation that learns how to harness these technologies to make sense of pockets of information on the frontier of human knowledge!</p>\n<p>As context windows expand, inference speeds increase, and per-token prices drop, we'll see huge impact from AI-enabled personalized indexing.</p>\n",

In fact, it's probably the least interesting way to use the technology.</p>\n<p>Thanks to tools like ElevenLabs, Midjourney, Kaiber, Runway's GEN-2, D-ID, Meta's MusicML, the cost of multimedia post-production is dropping like a rock.</p>\n<p>That means you can take any idea and weave it into an attention-grabbing content nugget, perfectly tailored to fit the constraints of your public channel of choice (LinkedIn in my case).</p>\n<p>What does that mean for the future of content marketing (and marketing in general)?</p>\n<p>Well, when charisma is commoditized, the the differentiator that matters will be the core information—and, to anyone who has a love/hate relationship with digital media, this is a GOOD thing.</p>\n<p>You won't have to hire an expensive agency to start publishing content. All you have to do is \"mine reality\" by tapping into the pool of digitized raw material that, thanks to remote work and the near-zero cost of digitization, all knowledge workers will be accumulating in the years ahead: Zoom recordings, interactions with clients, monologues prompted by context-aware AI like Rewind AI that elicits your expertise and helps you reflect on what you've learned over a given week with a short list of pointed questions.</p>\n<p>Credible experts have the most to gain: Information that's objectively interesting, novel, unique, and instrumentally valuable can be wrapped with AI-generated multimedia and frequently published, creating a trail of digital attractors that invite the right kind of attention and demonstrate trustworthiness.</p>\n<p>AI is already making it easy for individuals to gain HUGE leverage with AI-assisted coding. Software is a technology that turns labor into capital, and dropping development costs make artisanal software a reality for sole proprietors and small businesses that wouldn't have been able to afford tech teams even a year ago.</p>\n<p>Soon, AI will have the same effect on marketing. You won't need to pay the media piper to bootstrap distribution ex nihilo. All you need to do is create objective value and digitize the result, the process, and your clients' satisfaction.</p>\n<p>With that raw material, your AI post-production assistant can do 90% of the post-production and ask for occasional editorial input. By untethering message and medium (vs. the traditional reality show setup), you get the best of both worlds: the benefits of a public profile without the risk that comes with publishing EVERYTHING (remember, you ultimately control what info gets indexed).</p>\n<p>What does that mean practically?</p>\n<p>It's simple: Do good work, be curious, and remember to hit record.</p>\n<p>#ai #marketing #artificialintelligence</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>How do you run weekly executive meetings that don't suck?</p>\n<p>Here are 10 key takeaways from my presentation to Vidya Santhanam's Fitbots OKRs community:</p>\n<p>🚀 Inject Your Meetings with the Excitement of a Netflix Binge: Status update meetings can transform into engaging sessions that team members look forward to attending, much like anticipating the next episode of a favorite Netflix series.</p>\n<p>🧠 Activate the Organizational \"Nervous System\": By focusing only on the most pleasant or painful organizational \"nerve endings\" you can surface the most pertinent pieces of information and streamline decision-making during OKR check-in meetings.</p>\n<p>🎯 Empower Teams to Gamble on Greatness: Attendees should be held accountable for surfacing quality information relating to their objectives and key results, not necessarily for achieving them. This empowers team members to take risks and to remain aligned on their goals.</p>\n<p>🔥 Energy and Enthusiasm Aren’t Optional, They're Infectious: Bringing the same level of energy and enthusiasm as you would to watching your favorite TV show can make OKR check-in meetings more engaging and enjoyable for all participants.</p>\n<p>🎢 Embrace the Roller Coaster of Confidence Scores: \"Static confidence scores are an indicator of a bigger problem, and not just a result of a flawed OKR process.\" This issue is often related to the company's mindset and culture, as teams need to feel empowered to take risks, experiment, and adapt based on new information.</p>\n<p>🚧 Don’t Fear Missing a Key Result, It's a Goldmine of Insight: \"Missing a key result is not necessarily a bad thing.\" It is more about learning and generating insights that you can capitalize on, whether it's over the next week or the next quarter when you do the reflection.</p>\n<p>🌟 Stewardship isn’t Just Important, It's Essential: \"Quality stewardship is crucial and should be prioritized.\" The OKR process relies heavily on stewards reporting accurate, reliable, and timely information to ensure good decision-making and progress towards objectives.</p>\n<p>🎩 Pull Valuable Insights Out of Low Confidence Scores: \"Having a low confidence score can actually be beneficial.\" A significant drop in confidence scores can indicate that the team has uncovered new and valuable information that can be used to make better decisions moving forward.</p>\n<p>🎉 Turn Meetings into Brainstorm Parties: \"The OKR check-in meetings should be dynamic and engaging, with new information driving creative conversations and problem-solving.\" By ensuring these meetings focus on sense-making and planning, as well as sharing rich information through confidence scores and updates, the meetings become more valuable and enjoyable for attendees.</p>\n<p>🔄 Consistency in Rituals Is Your Lifeline: Skipping weekly sync meetings can lead to a rapid deterioration of the OKR process, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a reliable ritual and consistent format across meetings.</p>\n<p>Watch the full talk: <a href=\"https://lnkd.in/geb9T5At\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lnkd.in/geb9T5At</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Last week, I spoke with entrepreneur & fellow AI enthusiast Jono Matusky about how we've been using AI as a tool for exploration and discovery.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we talked about using large language models (LLMs) to uncover intersections and gaps in knowledge and how this new capability might impact fields like PR and marketing.</p>\n<p>In short, a layperson can now use a tool like <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> to traverse parts of the human knowledge graph previously only accessible to experts. Versus standard internet searches, LLMs enable near-instant synthesis and translation of raw information—a good starting point for exploration.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite ways to do this is by using <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> to simulate a panel discussion by researchers working at the frontiers of their field. By simply asking <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> to \"simulate and facilitate an impassioned discussion between these credible experts on [a topic you've just started exploring]\", you can identify issues that haven't yet been resolved by experts, prioritize primary sources, and identify credible individuals for outreach.*</p>\n<p>In other words, you can quickly find a \"dark spot on the map\" and step right into it...</p>\n<p>Jono noted that this LLM capability could allow folks in the media to identify interesting opportunities—finding gaps in current reporting or looking for overlap between their coverage beat and the trajectory of current events.</p>\n<p>Going one step further, journalists could use tools built on LLMs to help identify leading experts who may be able to provide interesting insight for a story. And vice versa: experts could use the models to better understand how to translate their message to the general public and identify those journalists who might be interested in their viewpoint.</p>\n<p>LLMs can be instrumental in crafting story angles, personalizing storytelling to the reader, and identifying whitespaces for stories at the intersection of topics that are typically not covered together but might be worth bringing attention to.</p>\n<p>It's probably not long before you could Newsprint to analyze current news coverage, cross reference it with top experts in various fields, and come up with a list of potential story ideas targeted at different types of news readers.</p>\n<p>We view these possibilities as parts of a general trend catalyzed by LLMs: one of lower-cost, bespoke software specifically tailored to meet the needs of top experts and professionals, affording them unprecedented leverage and more attention to invest in higher-level thinking and creative work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beware! Users should still expect LLM output to be made up (\"hallucinated\") about 20% of the time. Don’t use the “researchers’” names nor what they say during the debate w/o checking sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, we expect knowledge across the board—especially executives, marketers, and PR professionals—to start integrating AI into their daily routines at an accelerating pace in 2023.</p>\n<p>What do you think about using LLMs to explore \"dark spots on the map\"?</p>\n<p>Add a comment with your thoughts!</p>\n",

    "date": "2023-04-24",
    "content": " <h2>Key takeaways</h2>\n\n<p>Want to attract more high-quality leads, become a credible thought leader, and increase your direct response rates?</p>\n\n<p>You can use AI&nbsp;<em>today</em>&nbsp;to:</p><ol><li><strong>Accelerate market research</strong>&nbsp;by analyzing large, unstructured data sets (e.g., AI-transcribed podcast backlogs), saving time and money compared to traditional customer discovery interviews;</li><li><strong>Surface personalized insights</strong>&nbsp;relevant to your specific business goals, core competencies, and target ICP (vs. the one-size-fits-all summaries and industry reports published by traditional market research firms);</li><li><strong>Streamline high-quality content creation</strong>&nbsp;by working with a \"collage\" of raw material—including proprietary transcripts & semi-structured contextual information—for rapid drafting of thought leadership content, which you can then subject to critiques by AI personas modeled on your target audience that help you refine ideas through interactive dialogue.</li></ol><h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>In this piece, I'll explore how business leaders can leverage AI to enhance their marketing initiatives, especially regarding rapid market research and high-quality content creation. By harnessing the power of AI, business leaders & marketing professionals can mine deep insights from publicly available sources, craft hyper-targeted content, and ultimately improve their overall marketing strategies.</p>\n\n<h2>AI-Powered Market Research</h2>\n\n<p>Developing a deep understanding of your target audience—including their interests and frustrations, both moving targets in an increasingly dynamic world—is critical for business leaders who want to serve new segments and deepen their relationships with existing customers. Traditionally, customer discovery interviews have been the go-to method for gathering valuable information.</p>\n\n<p>I have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mitch-stein_customerdiscovery-productresearch-focusgroup-activity-7054441476704849920-wKL1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">been doing customer discovery interviews</a>&nbsp;(as a product manager, startup founder, and independent consultant) for nearly a decade; it's an area where almost all businesses chronically underinvest.</p>\n\n<p>However, I also understand why it's not as common of a practice as one might expect: A single cycle of 10, 25, or 50 interviews can cost $10ks of dollars in analyst labor & interviewee compensation (e.g., a $100 Amazon gift card) and take weeks or even months to gather information and collate it into a set of actionable recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Figuring out exactly which questions to ask and probe into is challenging to know prospectively, especially if the interviewer has little direct experience with the problem space the interviewees operate in. Additionally, the art of asking good questions is hard to teach—simply running a scripted process doesn't work particularly well since the most valuable information usually emerges via a skilled interviewer's adaptive, curious approach.</p>\n\n<p>AI can help streamline and enhance the discovery process by helping you mine precise insights from preexisting interviews done by skilled interviewers with individuals who fit into your target persona, allowing you to quickly gain a contextual understanding of a new market segment and adequately prepare to make a more substantial time & money investment into a cycle of traditional customer discovery interviews or launching a new marketing initiative.</p>\n\n<h2>Transcription and analysis</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks to state-of-the-art AI transcription models like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/openai/whisper\" target=\"_blank\">Whisper</a>, anyone with a laptop can transcribe and analyze large corpora of text from data-rich sources like podcasts and interviews.</p>\n\n<p>As I've written,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7044834382477484034?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7044834382477484034%29\" target=\"_blank\">you can (with a bit of help from GPT-4) transcribe an entire podcast interview backlog</a>&nbsp;of ~100 hours of content nearly for free. A few months ago, transcribing that much content would have cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n<h2>Personalized summaries</h2>\n\n<p>Once you've collected this massive amount of raw material, you can (literally) interrogate it with GPT-4. Think of it as an \"AI analyst pre-read.</p>\n\n<p>This approach affords you the following:</p><ol><li><strong>A ton of time and money saved</strong>: At $50/hour, simply having an entry-level analyst listen to this backlog would have cost you ~$5,000; per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI's pricing</a>, GPT-4 will \"read\" the same amount of text for ~$50 and in 1 hour. That's a two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in cost and wait time!</li><li><strong>Precise insights</strong>: When you engineer your AI prompts with high precision, you can craft context-aware questions that incorporate your goals and surface the most salient information; you'll be able to \"index\" the information in the transcripts in a way that best serves&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;ends. Compare this to generic summaries produced by third parties (e.g., traditional market research firms that publish one-size-fits-all industry reports) that prioritize information that may or may not be relevant to your most pressing goals, strategic considerations, and core competencies.</li></ol><p>Now you've extracted exact information about what's ,

    "date": "2023-04-11",
    "content": " <h2>tl;dr</h2><ul><li>Cryptocurrencies and AI will play crucial roles in the emerging exaptive economy, facilitating international transactions, ensuring digital content authenticity, and enabling AI-to-AI commerce.</li><li>Technological components like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and large language model-driven autonomous agents will interact with Central Bank Digital Currencies and potentially Worldcoin to form a global currency network.</li><li>The AI-to-AI commerce paradigm involves continuous digitization of information, interactions between autonomous agents, and value exchanges, allowing individuals to focus on solving real-world problems while generating passive income.</li></ul><h2>The Present and Future of Crypto</h2>\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency has become a controversial topic in recent years, with many associating the term with criminal activity and speculative gambling (and, thanks to situations like the FTX scandal, rightfully so). Despite this, I believe that cryptocurrency has the potential to play a crucial and valuable role in the emerging \"exaptive economy,\"&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exaptive-economy-accelerating-innovation-bridging-divide-ulstrup\" target=\"_blank\">which I've written about previously</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I will discuss cryptocurrency use, the future of Internet commerce, what a digital marketplace driven by bespoke AI-to-AI crypto transactions might look like, and the specific technological components that tie it all together.</p>\n\n<h3>Current State of Cryptocurrency Use</h3>\n\n<p>Today, there are three time-tested use cases for cryptocurrency: speculation, crime, and ideology.</p>\n\n<p>Speculation (gambling) is a function of crypto newcomers seeing others get rich quickly during periods of substantial capital inflow and want to get in on the action, e.g.,&nbsp;<em>Thanksgiving dinner in '21 when your unemployed 25-year-old nephew showed off his new car, paid for by Dogecoin</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, cryptocurrency has also been used for illegal purposes, including purchasing illicit products (see: Silk Road) and laundering money, since it allows individuals to make their transactions less legible to state authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The ideological aspect is rooted in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/24/cypherpunk-crypto-anarchy-and-how-bitcoin-lost-the-narrative/\" target=\"_blank\">cypherpunk movement</a>&nbsp;of the 80s/90s and the belief that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can provide a more secure and private form of money. The idea that a technology like Bitcoin could outlive an ideologically-driven individual (and is, at this point, probably beyond the control of any single person or institution) is compelling and meaningful enough that a nontrivial number of libertarianism-inclined folks have put their money into it without any expectation of immediate utility, causing some to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/18/969182201/bitcoin-the-religion\" target=\"_blank\">wonder if Bitcoin is like a religion</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Future Use Cases Enabled by AI</h3>\n\n<p>While the cases above may not paint the most positive picture of cryptocurrency, AI will open up new, more legitimate use cases in the future (and soon).</p>\n\n<p>These include:</p><ol><li><strong>Global knowledge work</strong>: Crypto can facilitate international transactions by making it easier for people to work together across borders. For example, I recently hired a contractor from West Africa who accepted payment in Ethereum, allowing for a seamless and efficient transaction process that would have taken weeks via traditional remittance/cross-border payment mechanisms (believe me—we tried). Market networks like <a target=\"_blank\">Replit</a> now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter\" target=\"_blank\">incorporate AI</a>&nbsp;into software workflows, making it easy for the next generation of talent to upskill and participate in the global economy. Integrating AI into communication and information-sharing media is lowering linguistic and cross-cultural barriers. Together, AI and crypto increase the liquidity of the worldwide knowledge worker labor market.</li><li><strong>Proof of reality</strong>: As AI becomes increasingly capable of generating synthetic content (e.g., deep fakes, AI-generated text), it will become more challenging to determine what is real and what is fake. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can provide a way to cryptographically sign and verify the authenticity of digital content, ensuring that it originated from a legitimate source (e.g., via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/john-light/validity-rollups/blob/main/validity_rollups_on_bitcoin.md\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin rollups</a>).</li><li><strong>Machine-to-machine commerce</strong>: The most significant use case for cryptocurrency in the future will be machine-to-machine (or AI-to-AI) transactions driven by autonomous AI agents. These agents will negotiate with each other and engage in complex, bespoke transactions for information or services. This development will likely disrupt traditional business models and pave the way for more flexible, value-based arrangements.</li></ol><h2>Technological Components</h2>\n\n<p>Several technological components will intersect and play vital roles in facilitating this broader economic transition.</p>\n\n<p>These include:</p><ol><li><strong>Bitcoin</strong>: As the oldest and most secure cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin blockchain can serve as the \"sound money foundation\" for the exaptive economy. It might be used to settle large-scale transactions between mega-corporations and nation-states (or, perhaps,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://balajis.com/the-network-state-2/\" target=\"_blank\">network states</a>).</li><li><strong>Ethereum</strong>: With its programmable nature and support for smart contracts, Ethereum will enable more complex transactions and agreements between machines, facilitating AI-driven commerce.</li><li><strong>Large language model (LLM)-driven autonomous agents</strong>: Projects like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT\" target=\"_blank\">AutoGPT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi\" target=\"_blank\">BabyAGI</a>&nbsp;provide a glimpse into the future of AI-driven and Internet-connected agents that can perform complex tasks, query APIs, and eventually negotiate transactions with other agents for access to proprietary information and services. While foundation models (like OpenAI's GPT-4) may always have an edge on open-source alternatives, developers are continuing to make it easier for individuals to host GPT-4 alternatives locally, giving them more control over a less-powerful (and lower-latency) model that can be shaped to fit a user's unrestricted preferences. I doubt it'll be too long before \"orchestrator\" supplants \"user\" as humans' primary role when interacting with computers.</li></ol><h3>\"Smart\" contracts and bespoke transactions</h3>\n\n<p>Ethereum allows for the creation of flexible \"smart contracts\" tailored to the needs of counterparties, including:</p><ol><li>Standard, incremental services (e.g., information processing by centralized, foundational model AI, which isn't so dissimilar from electricity),</li><li>Contractual arrangements between tokenized collectives like Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and token-holders (akin to the formation docs that govern the relationships between shareholders and corporations, respectively), and</li><li>Event-driven exchanges of information and value, the terms of which are triggered by external events (sort of like a consulting agreement with payment split into one up-front transaction and a second, results-based payment).</li></ol><p>While no one knows how these smart contracts will evolve over the long run, the flexibility provided by platforms like Ethereum will likely enable a wide range of programmable transactions, negotiated and codified significantly faster and more cheaply than traditional legal agreements.</p>\n\n<h3>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)</h3>\n\n<p>Another layer to consider is state-backed digital currencies, such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs); CBDCs, like the digital US dollar, may be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230315a.htm\" target=\"_blank\">coming soon</a>. These digital currencies enable direct, unmediated relationships between central banks and citizens of a nation-state, potentially replacing physical currency or existing alongside it, streamlining the process of public service delivery and tax collection.</p>\n\n<p>It's ,

    "title": "The Exaptive Economy: Accelerating Innovation and Bridging the Public-Private Divide with AI, Blockchain, and Spatial Computing",
    "date": "2023-04-03",
    "content": " <h2>tl;dr</h2><ul><li>Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, spatial computing, and blockchain technology have the potential to revolutionize work, especially artisanal or expert work.</li><li>The source of profit is an information edge. To maximize public and private benefits, we should seek a balance between allowing individuals to profit from their information edge and sharing that information for the common good.</li><li>Exaptation is the process where a solution to a problem in one domain can be highly applicable to another field.

This article explores a new architecture for innovation (the \"exaptive economy\") that leverages these technologies to bridge the public-private divide, accelerate problem-solving, and enable a more equitable and efficient market.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, the source of profit has been an \"information edge,\" i.e., knowing how to do something that no one else knows. A private individual or corporation can protect their expertise through:</p><ul><li>Maintaining secrecy;</li><li>Exploiting the natural difficulty of codifying it (because the knowledge is tacit, local, or embodied and thus not easily converted into formal language);</li><li>Cornering resources (including raw material and ecosystem stakeholder relationships); or</li><li>Publishing patents.</li></ul><p>However, private profit sometimes comes at the expense of public benefit: Someone who might benefit from \"secret information\" won't be able to access it unless they transact with the owner; hence, public goods have traditionally been subsidized by third parties (e.g., the state), although this is almost always inefficient (and, unfortunately, often ineffective).</p>\n\n<p>I argue that at the intersection of certain emerging technologies, a new economic system (the \"exaptive economy\") might be possible that allows producers and consumers to participate together in a global community (and market) and realize a more optimal—and just—balance of benefits that come from the various private and public goods downstream of innovation.</p>\n\n<h2>Exaptation and Innovation</h2>\n\n<p>At the core of this new economy is the concept of&nbsp;<em>exaptation</em>, a process through which a solution to a problem in one domain ends up being useful in another problem space. This phenomenon appears in fields as diverse as biology and engineering (h/t to <a target=\"_blank\">Dave Snowden</a> for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/l4-vpegxYPg?t=765\" target=\"_blank\">brilliantly explaining and illustrating this idea</a>).</p>\n\n<h3>Moonshot Projects: An Example of Exaptative Innovation</h3>\n\n<p>For my favorite example, let's look at how the capital-intensive Apollo moon mission led to the development of CT scanners.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1960s, researchers<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/belleau2/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;developed technology to scan the moon's surface</a>&nbsp;to plan for a safe lunar landing. Only a few years later, this same technology was repurposed into core components of CT scanners, now widely used in medical imaging.</p>\n\n<p>Paradoxically, moonshot projects can lead to groundbreaking innovation in seemingly unrelated fields. To achieve a breakthrough in one domain where progress has been slow or frustrating, pushing boundaries and taking extreme measures in a different area might be necessary. These ambitious projects can help solve more immediate, proximate problems in other domains, leading to a more comprehensive understanding and advancement of knowledge across various fields.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this: Might it be possible to address climate change on Earth by first figuring out how to terraform Mars?</p>\n\n<h2>Information as Both a Public and Private Good</h2>\n\n<p>The mechanisms of this new \"exaptive economy\" would incentivize workers to solve local and specific problems while also contributing to the broader public good by sharing the results of their work. How? An innovative architecture combining:</p><ul><li>AI's power to process and synthesize vast amounts of data,</li><li>The security and trustworthiness of blockchain to enable decentralized information sharing with flexible and fine-grained permissioning, and</li><li>The immersive capabilities of spatial computing to capture and transmit tacit knowledge.</li></ul><p>This new system would allow for the seamless flow of information between individuals and organizations, unlocking new possibilities for collaboration and value co-creation. Moreover, it will enable a more just and ethical distribution of wealth by allowing those who develop an information edge to benefit from their innovations while ensuring that the fruits of their labor are eventually made available to the public.</p>\n\n<h3>Comparing the New Architecture with Traditional Intellectual Property</h3>\n\n<p>You're probably thinking, \"Isn't this what the patent system is for?</p>\n\n<p>Roughly, yes—this new tech-enabled system is similar to the patent system in that it aims to balance the interests of public and private goods. Both approaches encourage innovation by allowing inventors or creators to profit from their work for a certain period and making the information available for eventual public benefit.</p>\n\n<p>However, the system I'm proposing has three key features that the patent system does not:</p><ol><li><strong>Real-time sharing of machine-readable information</strong>: Unlike the patent system, which requires a more bureaucratic process and a significant amount of time for information to become publicly available, infrastructure for the exaptive economy would support the continuous sharing of incremental data through endpoints legible to computers (e.g., via traditional REST APIs).</li><li><strong>Passive information capture and shared benefits</strong>: Thanks to AR, high-fidelity information derived from our interactions with objective reality will be more easily and passively digitized, allowing each of us to focus on solving problems and creating value without worrying about the logistics of packaging up (and protecting) intellectual property. We'll let AI handle post-production.</li><li><strong>Dynamic and adjustable privacy settings</strong>: The new system would allow workers to choose how much information they want to share and when to make it publicly available, unlike the patent system, which has a fixed timeframe for public disclosure. This flexibility allows creators to optimize their profit-seeking interests with the broader public good.</li></ol><h2>The Importance of Technology in Realizing the New Architecture</h2>\n\n<p>One key aspect of this new architecture would be&nbsp;<em>the role of AI</em>&nbsp;in facilitating the exaptive process. By continuously analyzing the data streams generated by individuals and organizations, AI systems could identify connections between seemingly disparate domains, enabling rapid knowledge transfer and novel solutions to complex problems. Unlike Google searches, which yield inch-deep and increasingly ad-ridden results, AI can take into context a searcher's circumstances, goals, and constraints, and then provide extremely precise and particular information drawn from abstract principles <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177\" target=\"_blank\">grokked</a> from a wide breadth of information space.</p>\n\n<p><em>Blockchain technology</em>&nbsp;would also play a crucial role by ensuring the trustworthiness of information in the public sphere and incremental expertise \"paywalled\" behind a public endpoint (see:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof\" target=\"_blank\">ZKPs</a>). Individuals and organizations could collaborate more effectively—perhaps through AI assistant intermediaries who barter for nuggets of insight on their humans' behalf—while ensuring that the value generated by their labor is commercialized via bespoke transactions (versus rigid packaged offerings).</p>\n\n<p><em>Spatial computing (VR/AR/XR)</em>&nbsp;will provide the means to capture and transmit the embodied knowledge that was previously difficult to codify and share (AKA MIT Professor Eric von Hippel's \"<a href=\"https://evhippel.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/stickyinfo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sticky information</a>\"). By enabling individuals to interact with their physical and digital environments more immersively and intuitively (versus being chained to a desk or glued to a phone screen), spatial computing platforms will both facilitate more interactions between users and objective reality while also generating richer and more detailed multi-modal data streams—streams available for retrospective mining that drives innovation across other domains.</p>\n\n<h2>An Example: The Master Boiler Technician & the Martian Engineer</h2>\n\n<h3>Tacit knowledge as a private good</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine a boiler repair expert in rural Pennsylvania who specializes in fixing early 20th-century models. He wears a spatial computing headset that records his daily labor. The raw feed from his headset is published to a public endpoint, with AI processing and extracting key insights. When a new homeowner in Texas encounters a similar problem with her boiler, her AI assistant scours these endpoints to find information that might lead her to a solution.</p>\n\n<p>The AI assistant discovers the expert's solution, obtains the relevant information for a fee (say, via digital USD or Satoshis)—perhaps even automatically given a person has given their AI assistant control of a pre-set budget—combines it with contextual information about her mid-20th century model and the tools she has access to, and finally guides the person step-by-step through the repair process. This way, the expert benefits by sharing their knowledge, while the homeowner in need gains access to specialized information that allows her to solve her particular problem.</p>\n\n<p>The expert starts earning passive income without investing in creating training content, video-based courses, custom software, etc. He can focus on doing high-quality work.</p>\n\n<p>Artisanal workers and subject matter experts would, for the first time, be able to scale the value they can provide (and capture) without having to sacrifice quality or decelerate due to bureaucratic friction; as long as they continue to move forward on their pocket of the innovation frontier, they will be able to increase the value of their equity in the private repository of digitized info that generate through the process of getting results for customers at higher levels of need.</p>\n\n<h3>Tacit knowledge as a public good (via exaptation)</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine a scientist working on a project to create a low-cost water recycling device for a Mars colony. She faces unique (and largely unprecedented) mechanical engineering challenges. By tapping into the \"exaptive economy,\" her AI assistant searches for potentially relevant information across various endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>The AI assistant discovers the boiler repair expert's insights, which, some years after he first streamed them, are now part of the public domain. A particular engineering solution used in the early 20th-century boiler just so happens to apply to an engineering bottleneck in the water recycling device on Mars. The scientist utilizes this information to develop the recycling device, successfully solving her proximal problem.</p>\n\n<p>This example highlights how the \"exaptive economy\" can enable connections between seemingly unrelated domains, leading to innovative solutions and breakthroughs. By sharing knowledge and expertise, we can accelerate problem-solving and drive progress in areas that may have been previously unimaginable.</p>\n\n<h2>The Future of Work in the Exaptive Economy</h2>\n\n<p>Together, these technologies (i.e., spatial computing, blockchain, AI) will form a lattice at the foundation of a new economy characterized by the rapid flow of information and the continuous process of exaptation. Similar to how spoken (then written) language, the modern state, the printing press, the joint stock corporation, and personal networked computers have allowed for coordination at greater levels of scale, I hypothesize that the aforementioned technologies will enable similar ends but at an unprecedented level of scale. Optimistically, this could lead to a more efficient, effective, and equitable distribution of resources and new opportunities for collaboration and value co-creation.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of spending our workday curating, packaging, and repackaging information (or anxiously clutching our sources of information edge close to our chests), we'll be able to delegate the most drudgerous work to machines and keep moving forward on the frontier, investing more attention into the most deeply human activities—those of creation, relation, and contemplation—making contributions to the common good, while also being justly rewarded for our labor.</p>\n\n<p>And at our current rate of progress (see:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/gpt-4\" target=\"_blank\">recent ChatGPT improvements</a>&nbsp;and Apple's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-demos-arvr-headset-to-top-executives-report-says/\" target=\"_blank\">forthcoming AR headset</a>), this exaptive economy might be much closer than you think...</p>\n\n<p>That's why, in the weeks ahead, I'll be publishing a series of articles, each written for particular workers whose roles will undergo massive transformation in the years ahead (e.g., CEOs, coaches, designers, home services specialists), on how to adopt mindsets and technologies <em>today</em> that will adequately prepare them to meet the opportunities and challenges presented by the 21st-century exaptive economy.

For example, before sending a check-in email to prospects, I revisit the transcript, find one or two items they were interested in but we didn't dig into, and then do a little research into the topic, including a valuable insight that recalls our discussion and provides some free value.</p>\n<p>✍️ Creating Higher-Quality Content, 10x FASTER: I use Vienna Hypertext's Scribe app to record monologues during my morning weekday walks and automatically transcribe them. Then, I shape the raw material with the help of OpenAI's GPT-4, Grammarly for copy edits, and Midjourney to create an eye-catching image for engaging text posts (including this one). More recently, I've been experimenting with D-ID and ElevenLabs for AI-generated audio and video.</p>\n<p>🚶‍♂️ Getting More Active: Incorporating AI into my workflow has allowed me to work on-the-go (literally dictating to my phone, rather than typing on a laptop), resulting +10,000 steps per day. I use iOS speech-to-text to \"write\" and \"read\" material with Speechify.</p>\n<p>👁️ Consuming Content Efficiently: I use summarize.tech for YouTube videos and Snipd for podcasts to save time and focus on the most relevant information. This has helped me mine insights from long-form content and be more discerning in where I put my attention.</p>\n<p>👨‍💻 Building Functional Software: <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> Plus helps me write and debug Python code for my projects, while Replit offers a marketplace for developers when I need extra help.</p>\n<p>💬 Providing Rapid and Precise Feedback/Instruction to Colleagues: I use Descript to record feedback and instructions (e.g. pitch deck first reads, where I verbalize my thoughts), then compress the transcript using <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> Plus into TL;DRs that I send with the video. This has improved communication and saved a TON of time (say, vs. traditional written summaries via email or Docs).</p>\n<p>🗺️ Exploring New Frontiers of Knowledge: AI helps me dive deep into topics relevant to my clients, identify top researchers, and even simulate panel discussions to understand different perspectives.</p>\n<p>It's essential to note that AI is not perfect, and you should always double-check AI-generated outputs before sharing them with clients or team members.</p>\n<p>But, once you start using AI to free up attention and energy to invest into building relationships, uncovering insights, cultivating a unique perspective, and spending more time in reality (unchained from your desk!), you'll never want to go back.</p>\n<p>Of the use cases above, is there one you'd like me to create a tutorial for?

    "content": " <h2>The \"Relocalization\" of Software</h2>\n\n<p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and consumer hardware is fundamentally changing how we interact with technology. While the client-server model and cloud-based software services have reigned supreme for years, we might soon witness a return to local environments powered by bespoke AI software.</p>\n\n<p>Here's why:</p><ol><li><strong>Lower cost of AI-driven software development</strong>: AI now enables the creation of customized software at a fraction of the price, allowing users to get precisely what they need instead of relying on generic, mass-produced software.</li><li><strong>Powerful consumer hardware</strong>: Devices like smartphones and laptops are becoming increasingly powerful, with specialized hardware that supports running AI models locally.</li><li><strong>Underutilized consumer compute</strong>: Most consumer devices operate at 50% or less utilization, opening up opportunities for AI to carry out tasks, like research or networking, during idle times, like when you're asleep.</li><li><strong>Privacy and data protection</strong>: As digitization becomes the norm, privacy and data protection are more crucial than ever. Local software reduces the risk of data leakage compared to third-party services and APIs.</li><li><strong>Cost pressures</strong>: With economic challenges on the horizon, users (consumers and corporate) will seek cost-effective alternatives to cloud-based services, opting to run jobs with local computing resources and bespoke software to save money.</li></ol><p>However, the transition to local environments will not be uniform globally. Emerging markets will continue to benefit from cloud-based services like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/post/edit/7046821325889273856/?author=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAVulxsBFyr0EzPHwXppryACSci3VX4WxgQ#\" target=\"_blank\">Replit</a>, a cloud-native, AI-enhanced integrated development environment. Meanwhile, at the other extreme, Urbit's peer-to-peer model is baked into the operating system, allowing all software to be hosted and run by the client.</p>\n\n<p>These different paradigms will coexist, but—based on my recent experiences with GPT-generated code that I've elected to run locally and NOT in the cloud—the shift away from the dominant client-server cloud-based software model of the last decade seems inevitable. I anticipate that \"artisanal\" software development will become a thing sooner than later.</p>\n\n<h2>Artisanal Software 🔜 Nocturnal AI Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of searching for venture-backed software as a service (SaaS) companies on Product Hunt or Google, we will turn to AI-powered tools like ChatGPT to write code for local applications, providing greater control over software functionality and data access while keeping costs low. The era of cloud computing isn't coming to a sudden end, but it's facing a new, compelling alternative in local software environments.</p>\n\n<p>In the years ahead, we could see a digital ecosystem emerge where AI running on your local machine interacts with other personal AIs and more powerful AIs like GPT-5. This interconnected web of intelligent agents could operate behind the scenes, maximizing the potential of your devices and working on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine this scenario: you have a personal AI running on your powerful laptop or smartphone, carrying out tasks while you sleep. Your AI searches the internet to gather information on a topic you're interested in, connects with other personal AIs to build your network, or even collaborates on a project. By the time you wake up, your to-do list is entirely different than when you went to sleep!</p>\n\n<p>While your personal AI is highly capable, it may encounter situations where it needs the expertise of a more sophisticated, centralized AI like GPT-5. In such cases, it can securely transmit redacted or anonymized information to GPT-5, harnessing its vast knowledge and resources to tackle the problem. Then, your personal AI can integrate the insights and continue with its task.</p>\n\n<p>This \"nocturnal ecosystem\" of invisible, intelligent agents could operate in parallel with our daily lives, enabling us to wake up to a wealth of new information, connections, or even completed tasks. As AI-powered tools become more prevalent and our devices more powerful, this interconnected web of local and cloud-based AI agents will work together to accomplish goals, optimize time, and offer users a seamless, customized experience.</p><figure class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQHAbR7qYDGn0w\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHAbR7qYDGn0w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1680095294514?e=1754524800&v=beta&t=s4KW1xbgL4KLY-jrlwzhhkyAhz9jE892Ph5eO1vR_Z0\"><figcaption><br>(to the tune of \"All Night Long\" by L.

This is particularly useful given the increasing low-cost digitization of information, which has created a mind-boggling amount of data that can be accessed through our networks and computing architecture. However, the problem of search has been monopolized by companies like Google, which limits the ability of individual entrepreneurs to access and mine this information set.</p>\n<p>AI offers a solution to this problem by allowing individuals to perform personalized search functions using large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT algorithms (which helped me turn a voice memo into this post) or Facebook's recently released open-source models. This enables individuals to create their own search engines and traverse the latent space of data quickly and efficiently, extracting insights from voluminous, high fidelity primary sources—then tailor those insights to their immediate needs and context. This unlocks creativity by providing raw material to turbocharge the creative process, allowing individuals to combine insights from disparate sources and solve proximal problems that stand in the way of longer-term goals.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, AI helps to deal with the problem of overspecialization by translating insights from deep areas of specialization (e.g., those locked up in academic journals and covered in a layer of jargon) into plain English and taking into account the context of the problem being solved. This enables individuals to generate a wide variety of hypotheses and engage in hyper-creative hypothesis generation based on their personal interests and strengths. AI 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝘄𝗻, but it allows individuals to scope and then conduct low-cost experiments to test their hypotheses and develop solutions with economic value.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that AI will not generate value automatically, BUT it can catalyze human creativity by allowing individuals to traverse the expanding surface area of digitized information, then extract, translate, and combine insights. This unlocks the potential for creativity and innovation, enabling individuals to solve problems and develop solutions with economic value.</p>\n<p>Ready to dive in?

Now, innovation can occur, and experiments can be conducted at an incredibly low cost by leveraging market networks like Replit</p>\n<p>These market networks, powered by a new generation of global talent with access to network computers and AI-driven tools, can address specific needs quickly and affordably. I have personally invested $650 in 3 projects and am amazed by the results, regularly using custom tech developed by engineers on Replit.</p>\n<p>What makes this new paradigm so captivating is that it significantly reduces the risk of whether an IT project's results might be valuable and usable by enterprise end-users. This is because the fixed cost of creating something that can be put into a user's hands has dropped dramatically – by at least one, if not two, orders of magnitude – even today in 2023.</p>\n<p>This means that C-suite executives, project managers, and product executives who embrace this innovative IT development approach may be able to reduce costs and increase the chances of achieving their desired outcomes with successful ERP implementations (which currently fail ~75% of the time, according to Gartner) and other enterprise IT projects by as much as 300%.</p>\n<p>By adopting this approach and conducting small-scale experiments before committing to resource-intensive projects, the risk of failure in IT projects can be drastically reduced. This is especially relevant for public officials who wish to leverage this new technology and emerging market network paradigm to deliver both private and public IT in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Accessing this global, liquid labor market for IT talent and enhancing the likelihood of successful value delivery at scale through enterprise IT projects could push GDP growth as high as 5 or 6 percent – an astonishing increase in economic productivity and wealth creation.</p>\n<p>This game-changing paradigm deserves greater attention from both private and public sectors. By harnessing market networks and emerging technologies, we can minimize the risk associated with IT projects, significantly increase success rates, and stimulate unprecedented economic growth.</p>\n<p>#ITInnovation #MarketNetworks #AI #DigitalTransformation #EnterpriseIT</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>On the eve of widespread access to multimedia generative, AI (GPT-4 is allegedly launching next week), it’s more important than ever that we consider using blockchain infrastructure to stay tethered to reality.</p>\n<p>The use of blockchain technology for transparency in supply chains gets a lot of attention. Many focus on its application in physical goods to ensure ethical production and sourcing. However, I believe the initial use case for blockchain technology lies in analyzing the information supply chain. By “following the money” (and in the case of cyberspace, reputation and attention invested) nearly instantly, we can understand who's funding the production of a particular bit of digital media and update our interpretation of said media accordingly.</p>\n<p>Public blockchain technology can help quickly analyze the provenance and source of a particular piece of information, as well as understand the goals of the different entities that contributed to its production, dissemination, and amplification. This critical infrastructure can aid Americans in making better decisions and differentiating between useful information and disinformation or misinformation.</p>\n<p>I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen a tweet with a lot of engagement that is blatant propaganda, and then spent a few minutes digging only to find out that the source is someone affiliated with an obscure organization that, below the opaque surface, has obvious political goals and “interesting” board membership (eg via IRS filings on a non profit site).</p>\n<p>We need to make it easier for Americans to discern information from disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, this is a promising use case for blockchain technology that the United States government should encourage and even invest in directly. Let us leverage this technology to ensure transparency in the information realm and empower individuals to make informed decisions in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>#blockchain #informationtransparency #criticalinfrastructure #publicsector #innovation</p>\n",

You can see the other side and where you want to go, but there is a foggy river in the middle, representing the uncertainty and complexity of pursuing a long-term goal. To navigate this foggy river and achieve your long-term objectives, you need clarity on three core components: mission, vision, and present-day position.</p>\n<p>Your mission is where you're oriented and what only your company should be doing. Your vision is a concrete instantiation of what material reality would look like if you're making headway on that mission. And your present-day position is where you are now, on one side of the river trying to get to the other.</p>\n<p>OKRs serve as stepping stones across this foggy river, helping teams to align their attention towards a common goal and develop an information edge that fuels growth. By dispersing the fog and uncovering insights, companies can reinvest in their business and ultimately achieve their long-term objectives.</p>\n<p>So, what's your next stepping stone? As I said in the presentation, OKRs are most effective when focused on a single quarter, but the art of this is given all of these different options and lots of uncertainty, which direction do you actually step out on into?</p>\n<p>Check out the clip for more insights on how OKRs can help you achieve your long-term goals, and share your thoughts on the metaphor of the Foggy River in the comments.</p>\n<p>#OKRs #LongTermGoals #Mission #Vision #InformationEdge #Growth #BusinessStrategy</p>\n",

The fifth element, the 'quinta essentia,' was believed to be a rare and elusive substance that was present in the heavens and was thought to be the purest and most perfect form of matter.</p>\n<p>𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 is the core means by which an entrepreneur uses his or her product to lead the user to an ideal future.</p>\n<p>(Fun fact: 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘵 is comes from the Latin roots 𝘱𝘳𝘰- and 𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘦, meaning \"lead forward\")</p>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upon first contact with a user, the product 𝘷𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘻𝘦𝘴 the user. In other words, it grabs his or her attention by presenting something novel yet familiar, exciting, or surprising.</li>\n<li>Then, it helps the user picture a concrete 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘧𝘶𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦, one where upon having used the product, he or she will have satisfied that desire.</li>\n<li>Finally, the product 𝘥𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘭 𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦 toward that promised longer-term end—an invitation to continue using the product.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, on one hand, this model makes me a little uneasy...it's been used by some tech companies to exploit human weaknesses—to take advantage of the \"7 deadly sins\" as one famous investor put it—and keep them stuck in dopaminergic loops that are highly vitalizing (initially), but ultimately unsatisfying.</p>\n<p>BUT, on the other hand, the same mechanics can be used by entrepreneurs who want to use technology to help customers achieve long-term, deeply satisfying goals. 🙏</p>\n<p>Just imagine...you're an entrepreneur who wants to do well by doing good, and you've built a durable, profitable business by doing the right thing & helping your customers flourish...</p>\n<p>You can take your very first step by asking your most engaged user (or dream prospect) the following question:</p>\n<p>If you could wave a magic wand and change 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, what would it be?\" 🪄</p>\n<p>You might be surprised by what they say...</p>\n<p>Then, when you're ready, take the second step by sending Matt Zerker a DM with their answer, and he'll show you to discover your own product's quintessence and use it to deliver long-term, satisfying value to your customers.</p>\n<p>Can you remember the last magic moment you experience with a quintessential product?</p>\n<p>Share in the comments 💬</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>We are currently living in perhaps the most opportune time in human history to start innovating...</p>\n<p>With the global talent pool growing more liquid by the day, and market networks like Replit reducing the complexity of connecting, vetting, and incrementally working with credible people from around the world, the cost of innovation is dropping like a rock.</p>\n<p>BUT, it requires a substantial change in how most innovation units—and even early-stage startups—think about the innovation process.</p>\n<p>Here are 3 tips for innovators who want to run rapid, effective product experiments at an incredibly low cost:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not accept the status quo: Whenever you run into a problem—e.g., friction in software UX, slow turnaround on a dependency, rote tasks that no one on the immediate team gets vitalized by doing—DO NOT ACCEPT IT! There most likely is a way to achieve your proximal goal 10x faster and 10x cheaper while still getting at least 50% of the quality. Tech (especially AI / LLMs) + the new generation of internet-connected knowledge workers around the world make it possible to delegate the alleviation of even the most incremental frustrations to tiny combinations of labor and capital. You immediately \"feel\" this when you post a Replit bounty for the first time, for example. You don't need a pre-seed round to go 0–1. On Replit, for example, you can get a custom data pipeline or Chrome plugin in less than a week for just $50 or $500, respectively.</li>\n<li>Maintain a ruthless, sober focus on results: get away from hours/inputs/etc. and scope micro-engagements with clients and sub-contractors in projects. Once you start collecting checks independently of concrete results, your rate of learning and, thus, innovation will plateau (an aside: industries that have traditionally relied on the billable hour model are RIPE for disruption). Turbo-charge this process w/ cash up-front + satisfaction guarantees for every single engagement.</li>\n<li>Accelerate learning with tight feedback loops and micro-accounting: Get away from Quickbooks and instead use a single spreadsheet to account for every teeny tiny bit of revenue and expense in the context of your micro-projects. You'll quickly get a sense of where the margins just by assessing your top-line vs. marginal costs for each. Then you can focus: with greater reliability (ultimately via code), you can drive a wedge deeper into the revenue/COGS gap until you're able to generate passive income with a pure software product.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We're in a new era where you can (and probably should) find PMF before you even start thinking about creating a c-corp.</p>\n<p>With access to talent via market networks, tech like LLMs that will increase total factor productivity, and a major dose of humble (and insatiable) curiosity, every one of has can have everything we need to build a capital-efficient bootstrapped business from scratch.</p>\n",

When we found content that caught our attention and demonstrated credibility, we went directly to the author in a direct message and asked them to help out with what we working on.</p>\n<p>We had no idea who or where they were—they were just avatars in a Discord channel—but we started with micro-projects to test their talent and professionalism.</p>\n<p>Even though 50% of the people we paid for project-based work didn’t ultimately stick with us, the other half did in a big way!</p>\n<p>Ultimately, a team of engineers and designers from Hong Kong to Mexico delivered nearly 20 completely custom VR therapy environments for only a few thousand dollars.</p>\n<p>We were able to start testing our very first with a psychologist and his patient in 2 weeks—not 2 months!</p>\n<p>The key was going to talent directly and delegating results-driven micro-projects, rather than simply “outsourcing” the whole process.</p>\n<p>For early-stage companies, there’s always been a lot to be gained from getting your hands dirty. But now, in the digital age, you can also get help from someone on another continent by partnering with and then delegating to them the tasks that they’re the expert in—and you are not.</p>\n<p>In 2023, we have at our disposal myriad ways of accessing “digital watering holes” where niche communities can coalesce and talented humans can work together from anywhere.

And having to write up summaries for the team takes your time away from critical action items.</p>\n<p>🔢 Follow the steps in this tutorial to delegate note-taking and summarization to your very own AI assistant!</p>\n<p>💬 What other CoS tasks would you like to spend less time doing?

If we get good results, I’ll try to get one or two more repetitions in with another client to see if I can reliably get the desired result.</p>\n<p>Finally, I’ll package that idea into a LinkedIn post (my current workflow is to record a daily</p>\n<p>monologue during my morning walk, transcribe it w/ AI, query my monologue with OpenAI ‘s GPT-3 to extract key points and create 4-5 drafts of the post, and put finishing touches manually).</p>\n<p>If it gets engagement, sparks and interesting discussion, or attracts DMs, then it might be worth investing in further.

Offer it at 10–50% of the \"offensive\" rate with a money-back guarantee and see if they pay you. If so, congrats, you just created your first customer without a website or single line of code.</li>\n<li>At the end of the interview, share a one-line description of what you're up to.

    "content": "<p>Setting good key results is essential to successful Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).</p>\n<p>Previously, I've written about what makes for a good objective.</p>\n<p>Knowing what criteria to look for when creating key results will help you craft a unified OKR, and help achieve the results you want.</p>\n<p>Those six criteria are \"quantitative,\" \"concrete,\" \"information efficient,\" \"coherent,\" \"stewarded,\" and \"exclusive.</p>\n<p>Quantitative: Each key result should be measurable. This means having a metric or a line in the sand that is binary, in that it is either achieved or not at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Concrete: Make sure the key result is specific enough that everyone agrees on the definition. The key result should be measurable right when it's set—not in the future. If the result can’t be measured right away, opt for a proxy or imperfect approximation of the result. You can test this criterion by asking execs to pull the metric's value RIGHT NOW, and if they get the same numbers, it's a concrete measure.</p>\n<p>Information Efficient: Each key result should provide information that the other two key results don’t. This doesn't mean \"uncorrelated\" per se. It can be satisfied by selecting one vital outcome and one quality input (which may be correlated in space, but not time—i.e., leading vs. lagging indicators). If the outcome takes a long time to achieve, the quality input will help the team focus on pulling proximal, reliable levers.</p>\n<p>Coherent: All key results should fit together into a unified whole, both with each other and the objective. This can be tested by asking yourself whether achieving all the key results will also result in achieving the objective.</p>\n<p>Stewarded: Each key result should have a steward. This person is responsible for having access to the right information to know the odds of end-of-quarter KR success at any given time. While their confidence score should be gut-driven, it should be informed by accurate and useful information they have gathered over the course of the week, and is shared at the weekly LT sync meeting.</p>\n<p>Exclusive: If you want extra constraints on the key result, you can make it more exclusive. For example, saying a key result should only pertain to a particular segment or geography will make it more focused and precise. This allows you to achieve additional depth (at the cost of breadth).</p>\n<p>By understanding the criteria for setting good key results, you can craft objectives that lead to successful OKRs. These criteria will help you create unified goals and increase the probability of achieving the results you want.</p>\n<p>#okrs #strategy #management</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Objectives and key results (OKRs) help businesses and teams stay focused on their goals and measure progress towards those goals. When executed properly, OKRs can lead to outsized results and help businesses and teams reach their full potential. It’s no wonder that they’re gaining popularity amongst executives and teams around the world.</p>\n<p>In my recent presentation to the Chief of Staff Network (thanks, Rahul Desai and David Nebinski for hosting!), I outlined the three essential steps for successfully implementing OKRs. The first step is to set OKRs. This involves an executive workshop of around five hours, preceded by preparatory trust-building and information gathering activities. At the end of the workshop, you should have one objective and three key results. These should be ambitious enough that there is a 50/50 chance of achieving them in a quarter. Each key result should also have a steward who is accountable for knowing the odds of success of achieving that key result.</p>\n<p>The second step is to sync weekly, which involves a meeting of around an hour to surface new information, make plans to exploit that information towards the end of outsized progress. The third step is to reflect quarterly, which is when we \"uncover the truth,\" mine insights, and shape company culture.</p>\n<p>The pitfalls to avoid when setting and tracking OKRs include: having more than one objective and three key results; sharing OKRs with external stakeholders (who will inevitably mistake a tool for learning for committed targets); skipping weekly check-ins; and allowing the weekly syncs to descend into status update hell.</p>\n<p>For teams of 300 people or less, weekly syncs are the key to success. This is when the key stakeholders come together to discuss progress on the key results and assign a confidence score of how likely they are to be achieved. This is also the time to identify any heroic narratives, i.e. a team member who went above and beyond expectations to achieve a key result.</p>\n<p>Finally, communication is key in this process. This can include recording and transcribing meetings, conducting anonymous surveys, and using a technique called \"backbriefing,\" where the strategic intent is communicated to everyone on the team.</p>\n<p>Overall, setting and tracking OKRs is essential to achieving business objectives, and it’s important to have an effective system in place to ensure that teams stay on track and progress is monitored effectively and efficiently.

(When Apple's AR arrives, things will get really interesting...) I'd also recommend recording daily monologues about topics that are interesting to you, so you can mine them for valuable content (I did this last week to create a LinkedIn post...will share how I did later this week). This private knowledge repository WILL BE the source of your personal information edge, and thus, ability to grow wealth.</li>\n<li>Make time every day to practice using AI as a part of your workflow. OpenAI's <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> is already ready. Ask it questions like it was a first-year analyst and give it knowledge work tasks at the same level (presentation outlines, email drafts, etc.). If you'd like to take things to the next level, try your hand at Midjourney or tune GPT to meet your more bespoke needs via the OpenAI Playground.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unfortunately, I think there are many knowledge workers and corporate leaders who will try to resist these changes (already artist communities are starting to declare Butlerian jihads against AI...), but if you can lean into the transformation as soon as possible, your future self will thank you for it.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to start wielding AI on a daily basis?!</p>\n<p>Like and reshare this post with a comment about how you might be able to use AI in your work today...</p>\n<p>#ai #digitaltransformation #technology #ar</p>\n",

This will make it easier for information to be consumed and shared asynchronously, as employees' primary communication channel will be the corporate AI. Think: a Slack DM (or, more likely, a private Urbit group channel) you can ping at any point for the info you need to get your work done.</p>\n<p>The cost of knowledge capture, management, and transfer goes essentially to zero, freeing up managers' time for more valuable (and largely relational) work, e.g., longer/more substantive 1:1s.</p>\n<p>This new corporation will also tap into an unprecedentedly liquid global labor market. With on-chain reputation systems, we can verify that someone is credible while preserving their privacy, allowing us to transact with them on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>This removes the need for costly and inefficient hiring processes that assume full-time employment. Hiring will happen incrementally and be project-based.</p>\n<p>Reliable, real-time translation will lower linguistic barriers; cultural barriers are already coming down as the next generation of workers will have grown up largely on the internet, allowing them to access common contexts regardless of where they were born.</p>\n<p>Finally, spatial computing will allow us to convene remotely—primarily for the purpose of generating emotional energy and building trust, NOT information sharing. We'll be fully liberated from our desks. Employees will be able to more easily build bonds via VR games like Rec Room, an activity that's far superior to Zoom happy hours...</p>\n<p>AI, VR/AR, and blockchain will allow us build new systems of coordinated human action—the 21st-century corporation—from first principles, generate unprecedented wealth, and free up our invaluable attention for activities—literally and figuratively—outside of the office.</p>\n<p>#ai #technology #vr #blockchain #futureofwork</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lnkd.in/ecDxgJbY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lnkd.in/ecDxgJbY</a></p>\n",

They are (from lowest to highest):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"Eikasia,\" roughly our immediate emotion responses to raw inputs from our immediate environment;</li>\n<li>\"Pistis,\" simple heuristics and \"just-so\" stories that use to quickly make sense of a stream of raw input;</li>\n<li>\"Dianoia,\" discursive critical thinking, through which we consider multiple interpretations and use reason; and</li>\n<li>\"Noesis,\" a deep, generalizable understanding that's almost like catching a glimpse of the source code of reality.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The thing is, moving up each level of the pyramid requires focus and unbroken periods of concentrated attention — so, if you're constantly distracted, moving from one external input to another, you'll inevitably get stuck at the lower levels. And if you stay stuck, then you'll never be able to get at the root of whatever it is you're trying to accomplish.</p>\n<p>How does this play out in the digital age?</p>\n<p>Let's take social media—Twitter to be very specific—as an example:</p>\n<p>Tweets are incredibly short, and because the algorithm is optimized for engagement, the tweets that are mostly likely to draw your attention (in other words, the most potent external stimuli at the level of eikasia) end up at the top of your feed.</p>\n<p>It's no wonder Twitter threads get adversarial and stay so emotionally heated! The medium is simply not conducive to moving past (at best) pistis ... everyone's simple heuristics/worldviews are further simplified and reinforced; nuance, the thing that emerges at the stage of dianoia, is lost.</p>\n<p>While perhaps less extreme, the same principle holds true for every other digital channel: from Slack to email inboxes to LinkedIn posts :)</p>\n<p>Knowledge work is ultimately about developing a practical understanding of the world that can be used to help people achieve their goals more effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>True understanding (those precious \"a-ha\" moments) requires movement up (and then back down) Plato's Pyramid.</p>\n<p>What does this mean in practice?</p>\n<p>Well, in an age of infinite digital breadth, it's more important than ever to develop a disciplined approach to achieving depth: e.g., attenuating digital distractions, batching your inboxes, and carving out ample time to contemplate.</p>\n<p>Ready to go deeper on a daily basis?</p>\n<p>Add your tips for staying focused and \"thinking better\" in the comments!</p>\n<p>#digital #work #socialmedia #focus #philosophy #productivity</p>\n",

But if you want to dig deeper and understand the underlying mechanisms that drive your organization's success, you may want to look at Aristotle's \"four causes.</p>\n<p>Aristotle's four causes are a concept from ancient Greek philosophy that can be applied to various fields, including corporate strategy and management.</p>\n<p>The four causes are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The final cause (the purpose or end that something serves),</li>\n<li>The formal cause (the shape or form that something takes),</li>\n<li>The material cause (the physical substance out of which something is made), and</li>\n<li>The efficient cause (the agent or force that brings something into being).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the context of company strategy, the final cause is the ultimate goal that the company is striving to achieve. There are multiple \"final causes\" at any given time: long-term vision and infinite mission, a proximal quarterly objective, and the priority atop your daily task list.</p>\n<p>To maximize team cohesion and coordinated action, all of these should be chained together.</p>\n<p>The formal cause is also important in corporate strategy. This is the shape or form that the company's strategy takes. It is both explicit (e.g., management processes, stated values) and implicit (e.g., unspoken cultural norms).</p>\n<p>In particular, the process of setting, syncing, and reflecting upon quarterly objectives (OKRs) is a key aspect of the formal cause. By establishing clear and measurable goals, and regularly reviewing and adjusting them, companies can ensure that their strategy is well-defined and focused on achieving their final cause, thereby cohering the final with the formal.</p>\n<p>The material and efficient causes also play important roles.</p>\n<p>The material cause refers to the resources and assets that a company uses to achieve its goals. This includes financial capital, human talent, proprietary technology, and access to insular networks.</p>\n<p>The efficient cause is the agent or force that brings the company's strategy into being. This is where human attention comes into play. In the age of digital distraction, companies need to create conditions that allow knowledge workers maximize their individual attention, align their daily activities with sources of intrinsic motivation, and direct that catalyzed attention towards a shared final cause (i.e., a mission-aligned quarterly objective).</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Chiefs-of-Staff can think about supporting their principals in the context of Aristotle's four causes: articulating a final cause, catalyzing efficient causes, implementing formal causes, and maximizing material causes.</p>\n<p>How can you apply Aristotle's 4 causes in your own work?</p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments!</p>\n<p>#chiefofstaff #startup #strategy #management #philosophy #okr</p>\n",

I know this sounds crazy, but outsized progress requires periods of unbroken focus, and we're able to achieve our deepest levels of focus in 90-minute \"ultradian cycles.\" If you can achieve the same outcome via other channels (e.g., asynchronous comments on a shared document), do that instead.</li>\n<li>Share meeting outcomes, outputs, and a time-boxed agenda in the invite. I wish Google Apps for Business could force users to do this before being able to invite anyone to a meeting...</li>\n<li>Spend the first 10 minutes reviewing the outcomes, outputs, sharing an \"up-front contract\" (UFC), setting ground rules, and sharing \"top-of-minds\" (TOMs). The UFC should give attendees the leeway to exit the meeting at any point if they feel it's not worth their attention. Ground rules should include filtering out all digital distractions. By verbalizing what's TOM (work or personal) for each attendee, that competing priority is neutralized.</li>\n<li>Hit record. Going forward (and thanks to AI), the organizations that commit to radical transparency by recording and sharing meetings by default will have a massive advantage over those that do not by radically decreasing the biggest cost drivers of management overhead: knowledge capture, management, and transfer.</li>\n<li>Spend 90 minutes in deep discussion w/ help from a multimedia tool like Miro.</li>\n<li>Spend 10m closing, ESPECIALLY getting real-time feedback via a \"fist-to-five\": ask attendees to put up a fist (complete waste of time) to five fingers (great use of time) and ask outliers why they didn't rate it lower OR what it would take to rate higher. This gut-driven information is GOLD. Use those insights to continuously improve meetings and surface insights that would otherwise be left unsaid.</li>\n<li>Leave 10m of buffer so attendees can break and prepare for their next engagement.</li>\n<li>Publish the recording, a transcript (that any team member can add comments to for async discussion of pertinent topics), and AI-generated summary (h/t Scribbl) to a public Slack/Teams channel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you stick to these, I GUARANTEE you'll start getting better results. And as leaders are expected to deliver better outcomes with leaner teams, human capital–efficient results matter more than ever.</p>\n<p>Any other remote team meeting tips?</p>\n<p>Add one in the comments below! 👇</p>\n<p>#management #remoteworking #AI #meetings #digital</p>\n",

These systems are optimized for keeping users engaged by providing them with just enough value that they can slip in information that serves the ends of third parties.</p>\n<p>For example, when you go to Google or YouTube with a particular goal (image 2), you will inevitably be tempted by third party–aligned content to go off-track, costing you valuable time and attention.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine instead if every single one of us has our own trustworthy, individual-aligned AI that accelerated progress toward our particular goal (image 3). It would protect our attention from distractions and serve us information that was likely to bring us closer toward our objective.</p>\n<p>Practically, the content that you'd be served in your digital news feed or search results would be prioritized according to the likelihood that it helps you achieve your current task, while ALSO being aligned with your longer-term goal. This is a subtle, but huge shift in how we might interface with the digital world.</p>\n<p>You could scale this up to remote-native, globally distributed organizations (image 4), where—while you're \"on the clock\"—the information you're served is aligned with the organization's goal. This would reduce management overhead dramatically by driving down the costs of knowledge capture, sharing, and personalized communication between team members.</p>\n<p>Practically, how might this be implemented?</p>\n<p>With the following ingredients:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A loss function: say, mission-aligned #OKRs with weekly confidence scores (which requires individual agency and long-term thinking!) and</li>\n<li>A high-fidelity, self-sovereign digital repository of your life: I'd imagine some combination of a GPU-enhanced #Urbit server for storage + compute, Rewind AI for continuous data capture, and Apple hardware, e.g., the forthcoming #AR product line.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a world where everyone has access to this new human-aligned personal computing stack, we'd finally be able to achieve Steve Jobs's original vision of the \"bicycle for the mind,\" freeing up our invaluable attention for investment in activities that make us MORE HUMAN: those of creation, relation, and contemplation.</p>\n<p>#technology #innovation #machinelearning #management #remoteworking</p>\n",

Green, David Maister, and Rob Galford's Trust Equation (see: <a href=\"https://lnkd.in/g84R6qFr).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lnkd.in/g84R6qFr).</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>SO, the next time you're doing a round of customer discovery interviews or speaking with a prospect for the first time, consider taking a page from the Summa and bringing some Thomistic love into the conversation.</p>\n<p>You might be surprised by what happens next...</p>\n<p>#startups #customerdiscovery #prospecting</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>When it comes to OKRs, I’m generally a stickler for the rules.</p>\n<p>But there’s one rule that I often break (and often recommend clients do the same)…</p>\n<p>It’s that key results should be independent and uncorrelated.</p>\n<p>Now, at first glance, this rule makes a ton of sense. Ideally you only have 1x objective and 3x key results for your whole company (yes, even if you have 100+ employees), which means that you need to be extremely information-efficient with your key results.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example scenario (based on a VC-backed MedTech sales team I worked with): The team has identified an untapped segment (mid-market community health centers that generate a certain range of volume for a certain procedure every year) that they need to focus all of their energy on serving extremely well to create a market wedge and generate outsized leverage for the year ahead.</p>\n<p>Of course, the ultimate outcome the team wants to achieve is $ in revenue, BUT because the sales cycles can take longer than a quarter, they needed to figure out how to measure proxy outcomes toward that longer-term end that they could meaningfully effect in 3 months.</p>\n<p>These were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>demos given</li>\n<li>first contacts with new prospects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, these two results are highly correlated, so with a “traditional” approach to OKRs you should only pick 1. However, because “demos given” is a lagging indicator (and it was a new segment), we decided to include “first contacts” as well. (There was a third result that measured the team’s ability to find one “super fan” customer, too.)</p>\n<p>And it worked fantastically. The team knocked it out of the park and dominated the new market segment.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Because the two results, while correlated in “information space,” were not correlated in time.</p>\n<p>It’s what I refer to as a “vital outcome” and “quality input” KR combo.</p>\n<p>At the first few weekly syncs, there wasn’t enough new information in re “demos given” to confidently make tactical changes, so the team instead focused on pulling the levers for “first contact,” which led to the lagging outcomes and generated insights, used to affect ALL outcomes.</p>\n<p>This intense focus on reliably achieving a proximal outcome (really a quality input toward the vital, longer-term outcome) created momentum that led the team to achieve something they didn’t know was possible in such a short period of time.</p>\n<p>So, next time you’re setting OKRs—especially on the “frontier”—consider breaking the “independent KR” rule by pairing a quality leading indicator with a vital lagging indicator, thereby allowing your team to strike a balance between high-agency action and long-term thinking that helps them do incredible things.</p>\n<p>#okrs #management #strategy</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Let's talk about \"status update hell\": what it is, why you're there, and how to get out...</p>\n<p>It's a Tuesday morning at 10am. You chug a cup of coffee and hop on Zoom for the recurring weekly \"team sync\" meeting. It's supposed to go for 60 minutes but usually lasts 90. There are 9 other attendees. Their eyes track from left-to-right for most of the meeting; they are reading email and scanning Slack threads while speakers rattle off a laundry list of last week's to-do's. Someone screen shares a project tracker. The status flags are green. There are no questions—only statements. Your gut tells you that the company is not on the right track. But there's no cell in the status spreadsheet for your \"gut feeling,\" so you stay quiet.</p>\n<p>I have bad news: you are in the 8th circle of status update hell.</p>\n<p>We all know that regular team syncs are critical—especially for remote teams—and, yet, these meetings too often devolve into rote performances of minimal substance. (And they cost $$$, especially at the exec level.)</p>\n<p>This is usually because there's not a unified, medium–long-term objective anchoring the discussion. When that common end is unclear, attendees will understandably revert to sharing information relevant to their own personal objectives, which may or may not be aligned with those of the broader team, let alone the company.</p>\n<p>The good news is that there's a way out—all you need to do is make a few simple tweaks*:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Anchor the entire meeting with a common, unified goal, e.g., 1 objective & 3 key results.</li>\n<li>Assign a \"steward\" for each key result. This person is responsible for sharing a single confidence score at the beginning of each meeting (0–100%) that the result will be achieved by the end of the quarter. Note that the stewards are not responsible for achieving the results, only acting as \"nerve centers\" that can aggregate the relevant information each week into gut-driven scores.</li>\n<li>Rank the key results according to the gap between last week's confidence score and this week's. A gap means something changed, which means there are insights to be mined, shared, and possibly exploited in the coming week.</li>\n<li>Ask the group two sequential questions: \"Why the change?\" and \"What might we do this week to turn X% into 90%?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In adopting this meeting format, you've implemented a filtering mechanism that selects for vital information—information that moves the team closer to its long-term goal.</p>\n<p>This means that there will be meetings where only a single key result is discussed. This is not only OK, but a desirable outcome—the attendees' valuable attention will be invested in the cognitively taxing and high-leverage tasks of developing causal models to make sense of the changes and generating creative hypotheses that you can test in the week ahead.</p>\n<p>To get out of status update hell, maintain focus on what's vital!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"simple, but difficult\" as Christina Wodtke says in \"Radical Focus,\" the BEST book on #OKRs and the source of the confidence score approach</li>\n</ul>\n",

I recommend doing it in the afternoon (1-4pm) so you can protect everyone’s high-quality attention in the morning, which can be invested into deep work.</p>\n<p>If you have four directs, that means that 2-3:30pm M-Th let’s say is budgeted for 1:1s.</p>\n<p>Then, create a private shared doc (I prefer a Google doc) with two sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A parking lot with bulleted topics to be attended to during the 1:1. If something comes up during the week (e.g., a “learning moment” opportunity after a poor interaction with a prospect or team mate), simply account for it in a single bullet so you can have a live discussion during the 1:1. I recommend keeping this list short - you’ll discuss 1–3 bullets during the 1:1.</li>\n<li>A table with 4 columns and three rows, where you’ll reflect monthly on performance expectations and identify opportunities for improvement. In the first column, identify the areas (one per row) that the employee is responsible for (e.g. “demand generation”) with a short, qualitative description of what they’re expected to achieve. In the second column, you will record your perception of the employee’s performance from 1-10. In third, the employee will use the same scale to rate themselves. Update this once per month and bridge gaps through dialog: first, those between your perception and the employee’s perception until you reach a shared rating; then, those between where they are and where they need to be (9/10, let’s say). This is an opportunity to get on the same page in terms of performance and identify activities they can use to improve performance (some of which will require investment on your or the company’s part).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach is both effective and efficient because it frames your conversations in terms of a simple formal structure (in alignment with the company’s goals) while leaving space for rapport building and deeper conversations that surface high-quality information.</p>\n<p>One last tip: when you get the urge to make a statement or give direction, ask yourself if there’s a way to ask a question instead.</p>\n<p>What else can managers do to take 1:1s to the next level??</p>\n<p>Add your tips in the comments! 👇</p>\n",

That way, I never check LinkedIn or Twitter out of boredom. I get a daily digest of messages to respond to that I can tackle efficiently with a batch process.</li>\n<li>Force myself to produce every time I open an app. If I’m going to allocate my attention to social media, I ensure that I’m treating that attention as an investment good rather than a consumption good. Practically, that means front-loading production. I don’t consume any content until I’ve first produced something I think will be valuable for folks in my network. Concretely, I’ve currently committed to one post and three comments before attending to anything else. If I can’t summon something, then I won’t dive in at all. This is tough, but it forces me to be much more discerning with where I’m putting my attention.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you can commit to batching incoming messages and front loading all social media use with production, you will get 10x more value from every minute you give to the platform.</p>\n<p>It’s tough, but totally worth it!</p>\n<p>Prioritize production—and just say no to doomscrolling.</p>\n",

If someone feels like they can't trust the people around them (or, more saliently, the institutions upon which they depend), they will discount future rewards because they feel more uncertain about the future.</p>\n<p>Technically, their \"time preference\" would increase, meaning they value what they can get in the present much more highly than what they could get in the future.</p>\n<p>Higher time preference is correlated with addictive behavior.</p>\n<p>Thanks to social media (and pre-digital mass media, frankly) we're bombarded with visceral stories of gloom-and-doom that undermine our trust in institutions, each other, and optimism about the future. It's no wonder so many people are self-medicating (with analog AND digital drugs).</p>\n<p>About a year ago, I started making significant changes in my information diet, in part by restricting my own consumption of the global information feed—in time (I don't check messages until 1p Mon–Thurs) and \"space\" (I'm extremely particular about what feeds I'm subscribed to).</p>\n<p>In less than a month, I noticed dramatic changes in my ability to focus on work that would yield long-term gains, endure long periods of discomfort, and general mood.</p>\n<p>I find myself naturally thinking in terms of long-term outcomes...how will what I'm doing today benefit me, my colleagues, my family, my friends, and my community a year from now? 10 years? A generation?</p>\n<p>This has made it much easier to step out of the dopamine-hungry Twitter stream, turn off the TV, and enjoy all of the moments I get to experience—fully attentive—in reality.</p>\n<p>If you want to feel better, consider taking measures to decrease your time preference by changing your digital environment.</p>\n<p>(And pick up \"Dopamine Nation\"!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lnkd.in/eesEGRgB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lnkd.in/eesEGRgB</a></p>\n",

Self-taught technical workers from developing nations are able to meaningfully compete for remote jobs, now able to disintermediate the outsourcing aggregators through which they would have had to sell their services during the 90s and 2000s.</p>\n<p>To take advantage of this global liquid labor market, companies must find ways to reduce the cost of knowledge capture, management, and sharing.</p>\n<p>Right now, even the savviest remote teams spend altogether too much time writing and reading documentation. These labyrinths of notion pages in Google Docs, quickly go stale, and are “lossy”: much of what they contain is irrelevant to a new worker’s particular task or lacks critical information (aka “tacit knowledge”).</p>\n<p>I anticipate that every start up and large corporation will have their own artificial intelligence agent that employees will be able to query when they have a question, like a private Google.</p>\n<p>That agent will respond to the same types of natural language quarries that an employee might ask his or her manager with exactly the information they need to do their work…</p>\n<p>This, though, is contingent upon the continuous capture of information, especially tacit knowledge.</p>\n<p>This is more easily done by remote teams who can record everything he gets discussed during meetings, on calls with prospect, etc. with the click of a button.</p>\n<p>It’s an uncomfortable shift and requires tremendous trust, but if you’re able to get your team on board with “record by default,” I anticipate that you will generate a massive competitive edge in the next 2-5 years.</p>\n<p>Something for remote teams to consider! 📹</p>\n",

His syncretic experimentation is the basis for modern yoga-as-fitness.</p>\n\n<p>He was a \"fitness influencer\" over a century before Instagram. Sandow's fans sent him thousands of handwritten letters. His autobiography,&nbsp;<em>Strength and How to Obtain It</em>, includes a healthy sampling of those letters. Though stylistically different than posts you might read on an internet forum, these letters are eerily similar in content: from words of gratitude for the life-changing impact of his exercise routines to specific requests for expertise.</p>\n\n<p>I came across Sandow a few years back while perusing the Reddit community /r/fitness. One user asked:</p><blockquote>What does a highly trained NON-steroid body look like? With all the celebrities doing it 'naturally' but most likely supplementing to get their physique, I'm not sure what a clean result would look like. Anyone have any examples to separate Hollywood fiction from realistic fact?</blockquote><p>Another user pointed out that chemists didn't synthesize exogenous testosterone until 1935, so we can be confident that Sandow achieved his strength with neither protein nor pre-workout powders, let alone the hard stuff.</p>\n\n<p>This piqued my interest. The man was able to achieve what so many 21st-century fitness gurus promise and help other hopeful strongmen (and women) do the same. Per his wild popularity, commercial success, and the results contained in private letters from students and admirers—many of whom sent Sandow black-and-white photographs and columnated physique measures in a familiar before-and-after format—what he prescribed seemed to work. Moreover, his pupils achieved their results without expensive machinery, chemical enhancements, or any dazzling variety of fitness products such as those now hawked to us through late-night infomercials and social media advertisements.</p>\n\n<p>I read his autobiography cover-to-cover and was surprised to find that, despite my initial skepticism, it contained sound wisdom. His observations and prescriptions are relevant not only to fitness fanatics curious about the movement's early days but also to modern knowledge workers who want to achieve peak cognitive performance.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I learned:</p><ol><li>Exercise your mind.</li><li>Be moderate in all things.</li><li>Newer is not necessarily better.</li><li>Take cold baths. 🥶</li><li>To level up, work with an instructor.</li></ol><h2>Exercise your mind.</h2>\n\n<p>These are the opening lines of&nbsp;<em>Strength and How to Obtain It</em>&nbsp;(the emphasis is mine):</p><blockquote>Hundreds of letters reach me daily, asking, \"Can I become strong?\" Yes, you can all become strong&nbsp;<strong>if you have the will and use it in the right direction</strong>. But, in the first place,&nbsp;<strong>you must learn to exercise your mind</strong>. This first of all lessons in physical training is of the utmost ,

    "content": "<p>When I work with founders who want to regain their attention from digital distractions and break free from the chronic stress that accompanies a compulsive e-mail habit, I start by helping them make one simple change…</p>\n<p>It’s to keep their screen-based devices out of their bedrooms.</p>\n<p>When you’re ready to start taking attention management seriously, this one change alone will yield more value than almost any other technique.</p>\n<p>But, it is SO HARD.</p>\n<p>For many (if not most) of us, the faint glow of our phone screens is the last thing we see at night and one of the first things we take in in the morning.</p>\n<p>Going cold turkey can be brutally difficult.</p>\n<p>That’s why I recommend easing the transition by placing two substitutes on your bedside table:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An engaging book: This doesn’t have to be a “nutritious” tome. In fact, I recommend selecting something altogether “junky”—a juicy tabloid, a graphic novel, some pulp fiction. When you’re craving stimulating information, it’s easier to resist the urge to check your digital notifications or your favorite social media platform if you have physical media (literally) at hand that satisfies the underlying desire driving your behavior.</li>\n<li>A notebook + expensive pen: If you’re not in a pure “consumption” mood, you might instead benefit from focused production. Journaling can be useful and, for some people, articulating their thoughts on paper may scratch this itch; however, I actually recommend using your bedtime notebook primarily as a doodle repository. Let your mind wander freely and see what emerges from the page—without the added pressure of restrictive language. Keep going until you’re asleep or the page is full with ornate details.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What’s interesting about doodling is that it is an exercise in focused concentration, a foundational skill necessary to thrive in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Compare that to, say, what you get from spending a commensurate amount of time scrolling on TikTok: the opposite—you fragment your attention in a mode of pure consumption, which has the effect of disrupting your sleep and degrading your ability to focus and do quality work the next day.</p>\n<p>Want to strengthen your mind and regain your attention from digital distractions?</p>\n<p>Give doodling a try this evening!</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Life is but a series of marshmallow tests.</p>\n<p>And we are awash in a sea of digital marshmallows...</p>\n<p>Many years ago, I came to the realization that delayed gratification was the key to happiness.</p>\n<p>With each temptation that I resisted, I found myself becoming more calm, more focused, and more confident. It became easier to make good decisions, discern opportunities from distractions, and choose well. I have never since regretted taking a long-term perspective.</p>\n<p>In the 90s, the average American found herself tempted by marshmallows made of atoms: As a college undergrad, for example, you could choose between studying for a final or drinking on frat row. Once you committed to holing yourself up in the library, the siren song of a night wasted (no pun intended) went silent. Your friends wouldn't even know where you were, let alone how to bother you.</p>\n<p>As the ancients knew, it's never been easy for humans to make good decisions, BUT in the pre-digital world it was harder to make bad ones.</p>\n<p>Our choices were limited by local constraints in time and space; we were necessarily discerning. Every step you took required time, energy, and—if, say, you wanted to call a cab to head to that frat party—physical cash.</p>\n<p>But now, making bad decisions is easier than ever.</p>\n<p>You can order booze and burritos directly to your apartment. You can find charismatic bloggers and YouTube creators that reinforce your imprudent beliefs, gain your trust, and hawk their wares. You can access cheap credit with frictionless options to \"buy now and pay later\" at checkout. You can stream any particular selection of engaging (and, soon, immersive) digital content directly into your eyes and ears, substituting socialization, intimacy, and meaning with hyper-engineered simulations.</p>\n<p>Although these bad choices are somewhat limited to the world of bits, thereby mitigating catastrophic consequences, they are insidious and should carefully be avoided precisely for the same reason. Short-term errors compound, and without sufficient pain, there's no correction through learning.</p>\n<p>On one hand, if you substitute an evening out for one of solitude, game-controller in hand, you don't run the risk of getting hit by a drunk driver.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, while a Drizly-enhanced evening of Fortnite might leave you \"only\" with a hangover and a twang of embarrassment after purchasing a lavish digital item, that same activity (unlike the night out) is always at hand—literally a few button-pushes and swipes away.</p>\n<p>Feeling bored at \"work\" (you work at home)? Unhappy with the state of your social life? Feeling particularly rattled by warzone footage you came across on Twitter?</p>\n<p>Just eat a marshmallow.</p>\n<p>Because we now have the ability to work, play, and socialize through digital media, it's easy drown in short-term satisfaction by scarfing down handfuls of mini-marshmallows throughout the day.</p>\n<p>The next time you're tempted by a digital marshmallow, don't eat it.</p>\n<p>Your future self will thank you for it.</p>\n",

Drastically.</p>\n<p>I shut off my laptop and phone strictly between the hours of 8pm and 8am every day. I unplugged completely on Sundays. I turned all of my screens to greyscale and deleted all social media apps (and then logged out of the web versions). I made the switch to Superhuman, kept my phone out of the bedroom, and waited to check my inbox (i.e., email, Discord, Slack, Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger) until 1pm every day.</p>\n<p>I eschewed podcasts and music during workouts. I even averted my eyes from cable news when I caught glimpses of it at the gym and in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>I spent a growing amount of time alone with my thoughts. And, man, was it painful (at first).</p>\n<p>I'd forgotten what it was like to be bored, a feeling of which I had vague memories: waiting for my parents to pick me up from elementary school, making my way through heats at a weekend swim meet, afternoons at the local library spent searching through book indices on a quest for information that I could write on paper notecards and turn into a research paper on Nepal.</p>\n<p>After about 10 tough days, I started noticing changes...</p>\n<p>Tasks that I previously had zero interest in doing—from unloading the dishwasher to troubleshooting an issue with our home internet connection—suddenly became quite interesting.</p>\n<p>Those local problems that needed my attention were no longer competing with digital distractions, and I found myself actually ENJOYING doing chores around the house.</p>\n<p>Now, when I read or listen or watch, I slow down and absorb information, rather than inhale it. My sleep is immaculate. The quality of my thinking (and work product) is MUCH higher.</p>\n<p>I'm doing less, but better.</p>\n<p>Have you ever tried a digital detox? How did it go?</p>\n",

It’s time to learn how to do more with less.</p></blockquote><p>Although recent rate hikes have spooked some investors (and growth+ stage tech companies have gotten crushed), they’re unlikely to impact early-stage financing for at least a few years.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, that relieves some anxiety for early-stage founders who think equity financing is the right path.</p>\n\n<p>However, it also means that later-stage investors (including public market participants) will be less tolerant of traditional tech 10x+ P/E valuations commanded by startups that aren’t purely technology companies. As a result, the era of VC-backed “tech-enabled” services businesses is waning.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the end of a 14-year run that began with Uber, was fueled by infinite QE post-2008, and reached its peak sometime around the unsuccessful WeWork IPO.</p>\n\n<p>Although there’s a lot of “dry powder” ready to be deployed, earlier-stage investors may be hesitant to invest in your startup if your DCF model disappears off into the horizon; it will be difficult for them to convince fund GPs at higher rungs of the equity financing ladder to purchase shares at the requisite price.</p>\n\n<p>This is something that I didn’t fully appreciate before diving headfirst into the startup world: Although, yes, professional investors will always care about fundamental company quality, when they listen to your pitch, they’re also trying to calculate the odds that they’ll be able to sell what you’re selling to their prospects (Series A to B, B to C, etc.) and quickly.</p>\n\n<p>In the years ahead, the bars for each successive round of startup financing will be higher than at any time in the last decade.</p>\n\n<p>In parallel, customer acquisition costs will continue to rise thanks to Apple’s war with Meta, which has put upward pressure on ROAS (return on ad spend) hurdle rates.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the startups that survive will be the ones that generate more profit, sooner.</p>\n\n<p>Practically, entrepreneurs must figure out how to do more with less. More profit with less capital. More effective campaigns with less marketing spend. More value delivered to customers in fewer product release cycles.</p>\n\n<p>To survive (and thrive), founders will need to make deeper, narrower, more precise bets. And the kind of decision-making that&nbsp;<em>works</em>&nbsp;in this more resource-constrained environment necessitates a rigorous approach to strategy and company management that gets teams hyper-focused, aligned, and free of the distractions that were more tolerable when money was cheap.</p>\n\n<p>Cash will always be king. But financing will no longer eclipse operations.</p>\n\n<p>The 0% interest rate reign is over.</p>\n\n<h3>What should you do about it?</h3>\n\n<p>Get focused. Take strategy seriously.

    "content": " <p>For the past few years, I've been helping venture-backed startup founders and small business owners \"do\" OKRs.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what sometimes happens:</p><ol><li><p>Talented founders raise a bunch of money and hire like crazy.</p></li><li><p>Chaos ensues. New hires are eager to help, but collectively aren't moving the needle as much as VC money necessitates. The founders realize that how they were running the startup in the early days does not scale.</p></li><li><p>One of their investors (or another founder) tells them to try OKRs.</p></li><li><p>The CEO skims a few blog posts on OKRs or a book like&nbsp;<em>Measure What Matters.</em></p></li><li><p>Execs spend a day or two creating a bunch of objectives and key results, which are handed off to lieutenants to implement with their respective teams.</p></li><li><p>Months pass.</p></li><li><p>It doesn't \"feel\" like the OKRs are doing anything (and, TBH, everyone has forgotten what the OKRs were).</p></li><li><p>A chunk of the investors' money is gone.</p></li><li><p>The founders start getting anxious because it feels like they're working harder than ever but not making enough progress, and they're not quite sure why.</p></li><li><p>Someone close to the CEO (their chief-of-staff, an advisor, or a biz ops lead) will start pinging private chat groups and MBA program alums, asking for help.</p></li><li><p>I'll get connected, learn more about the specific situation, and help them make the right changes.</p></li></ol><p>Although every business is different, I've found that there's usually one common problem we need to address before we dig into templates or schedule workshops.</p>\n\n<h3>What's the problem?</h3>\n\n<p>The leadership team didn't understand how OKRs fit into their journey before trying to use them.</p>\n\n<p>The \"paint-by-numbers\" approach to OKRs is straightforward enough. But unless you first understand the \"spirit\" of OKRs and how they fit into your existing map of startup reality, they're unlikely to stick.</p>\n\n<p>That's why—before anyone sticks a single post-it to a whiteboard—I share a metaphor:</p><blockquote><p>Building a startup is like crossing a foggy river to get to the top of a hill on the other side.</p></blockquote><p>You start your entrepreneurial journey on a riverbank, gazing across the water at your ultimate destination: an unoccupied plot of land at the top of a hill where you'll build a world-changing, value-creating institution that will last generations.</p><figure><img data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQFv7gblMDKpcg\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFv7gblMDKpcg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1666372521760?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=QP4YQhfeEXYTJzW8Bl6GwJwFpAeXTGH_bycSqdRAlvc\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Like a compass that points north, the direction of that ultimate destination (no matter where you find yourself during customer discovery, pacing up and down the shoreline) is your&nbsp;<em>mission</em>. The future reality on top of the hill is your&nbsp;<em>vision</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Your mission and vision remain relatively fixed. Maybe once a year, you rise above the startup chaos and check if you're still in alignment.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the challenge: to get to the other side—to achieve your mission and manifest your vision—you need to cross the river. And the river is covered in a thick layer of fog. So the shortest path from where you are to where you ultimately want to go is&nbsp;<em>radically unknown</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But just a few feet ahead of you, if you squint hard, you can see a few flat rocks poking out of the water. You have a strong hunch that beyond some of those proximal stepping stones are other stepping stones, and if you take the proper steps forward, you will be able to cross the river and achieve great success.</p><figure><img data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQFBNlLk1K8eyA\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFBNlLk1K8eyA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1666372552457?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=6diyttFhp9maxHpH3HUj6GdJFYPhrFW1kY1hGKpah-M\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Those big stepping stones you can barely see, right at the edge of the fog, are possible&nbsp;<em>objectives and key results</em>. They're close enough that you can perceive them but far enough away that you can only step towards one at a time: No matter which stone you choose, it'll take about three months (one quarter) to get there.</p>\n\n<p>You've got food in your satchel (capital in your bank account) and an unfinished river map (internal knowledge base).</p>\n\n<p>You try to get closer to your ultimate goal with every step. At the very least, you dispel the fog and explore the dark spots on the map.</p>\n\n<p>Through this process, you discover two types of unexpected&nbsp;<em>insights</em>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Limiting factors</strong>&nbsp;that prevent you from making additional progress (e.g., a competitor who turns out to have an exclusive distribution deal with a prospective channel partner) and</p></li><li><p><strong>Growth factors&nbsp;</strong>you can leverage to accelerate forward motion (e.g., an unanticipated customer need for which your proprietary tech is the perfect solution).</p></li></ol><p>Every quarter, you take stock of these insights and exploit them to take bigger and better steps forward. You direct your limited energy toward removing limiting factors and catalyzing growth factors. These insights compound, giving you an information edge, difficult for incumbents and competitors to replicate.</p>\n\n<p>Your teammates are like cells in your body (it's no coincidence that the root of \"corporation\" means \"body\"). With scale, they specialize in a departmental structure (organs) with restricted fields of view. The chief executive needs to synchronize these components with his or her strategic intent.</p>\n\n<p>The executive team can achieve synchronization by orienting components toward two aligned ends:</p><ul><li><p>The company's long-term mission + vision and</p></li><li><p>1x shorter-term objective and 3x key results.</p></li></ul><p>Without those unifying ends, the team's motion will be \"stochastic\" or \"Brownian,\" i.e., lots of&nbsp;<em>work</em>&nbsp;but little&nbsp;<em>movement</em>&nbsp;in the right direction. It's what happens when your team members work their tails off for weeks or months—but when you turn around to gauge progress, you realize you're not so far from where you started.</p><figure><img data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQGSqITSNwkFOg\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGSqITSNwkFOg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1666372610999?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=ValhcS3C-lCB_JUrgPOhIFW5m_S56VFmSZqUPiI8YHw\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Unified or not, those cells (employees) are hungry for calories, so your cash will dwindle regardless of whether you're getting closer to the other riverbank.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, if you want to make outsized progress in the right direction while you scale your team, you should select a single proximal objective and maintain focus company-wide with weekly and quarterly heartbeats.</p>\n\n<p>How?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Plan quarterly.</strong>&nbsp;Set 1x objective and 3x key results in no more than 5 hours.

    "date": "2022-09-09",
    "content": " <p>In retrospect, it was inevitable. The internet—which was supposed to make us more connected—has loosened the informational ties that bound us together in the 20th century.</p>\n\n<p>With unmediated access to source material and near-zero publication costs, digital media has had the effect of both illuminating the truth and blinding us to it.</p>\n\n<p>For millennia, human beings gazed upon a reliable night sky and constructed a library of constellations. Upon (or from) the signs of the zodiac came stories that everyone could agree upon; these narratives contained a sufficient degree of objective truth, some practical knowledge, and social glue that would bind communities with a common mythos.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in the 20th century, professional academics and other epistemic intermediaries gazed upon primary sources and constructed constellations of history (connected to the present via the news).</p>\n\n<p>The proliferation of internet access has “lit up the informational night sky,” allowing every individual to gaze upon a vast sea of digital data and construct his own constellations. There are benefits: Discoveries on the frontier of human knowledge, illumination of previously dark spots on the map of reality, and an unprecedented ability for individuals to speak truth to power. We are in an era where, in the long run, power will find it difficult to conceal itself. This is good.</p>\n\n<p>But, there are also significant downsides: With the number of “stars in the sky” increasing at an accelerating pace, we can more easily string together data to support an imaginal construct. This widespread activity is rather unsurprising in a postmodern world, where a healthy skepticism of power taken to the extreme leaves atomized postmodern man with the raw material and technology to construct a self-centered metanarrative, a high-fidelity and (perhaps most insidiously) internally consistent Zodiacal “mythos of me.”</p>\n\n<p>Something analogous happened in the 16th century with the printing press and the Protestant Reformation. And then, just as now, unmediated access to source material often yielded value. But it also caused European society to fracture violently and allowed individuals, blinded by new information (and pride), to introduce and propagate errors.</p>\n\n<p>Conspiratorial thinking is nothing new. It’s a perennial human activity (in the west, antisemitic conspiracy theorizing in particular: see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/martin-luther-quot-the-jews-and-their-lies-quot\" target=\"_blank\">Luther</a>&nbsp;500 years ago or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism\" target=\"_blank\">Marcion</a>&nbsp;and various&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Gnosticism\" target=\"_blank\">other Gnostics</a>&nbsp;2000 years ago). We can’t help ourselves but connect the dots. Now, there are so many dots that we can—emboldened by a culture that does not take objective reality very seriously—construct whatever pictures we want.</p>\n\n<p>The typical postmodern internet conspiracy theorist makes a critical error regarding his primary motivation: He claims to pursue the truth. Often, the subtler aim—one to which we are all susceptible—is to feed his ego with a self-impressed narrative that demonstrates how smart and enlightened he is, especially compared to the stupid masses of sheep. This error is compounded further by three factors:</p><ol><li>The difficulty of discerning the imaginal from the real in cyberspace,</li><li>Insufficient contact with reality, and</li><li>The refusal of traditional epistemic elites to acknowledge nuggets of truth contained within the conspiracy theory.</li></ol><p>From my limited understanding of psychological warfare, the standard approach to combating conspiratorial projects is to flood the information sphere with noise or attempt to shape narratives from within through infiltration. While this may be effective in the short term (and I understand why there would be practical reasons to take this approach in “war time“), it is insufficient in the long run. Instead, those in power who genuinely care about the good should commit to taking objective reality seriously again by:</p><ol><li>Dedicating institutional resources to the dissemination of the truth, no matter how painful or embarrassing acts of public revelation might be to elites and statesmen who have committed errors, and</li><li>Arming the next generation, through technology-enabled public education, with tools for critical thinking (“how to think,” not doctrinal declarations of “what to think”).</li></ol><p>If we want to preserve our institutions—and we absolutely should—then we must abandon the postmodern project and start taking reality seriously. Through that (painful) process, every single one of us will be able to raise our eyes toward the same night sky, one further illuminated by bright new points visible through the great gifts afforded to us by the miracles of networked personal computing technology, and a behold a common view of reality as it actually is—and with unprecedented clarity.</p>\n\n<p>The truth has always, does, and will always set us free. Self-serving heresies do not.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s get back to reality.</p>\n\n<h2>Seeking truth in the digital age</h2>\n\n<p>At <a target=\"_blank\">Virgils Inc</a>, we are committed to helping families thrive in the digital age.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re concerned about the dangers of digital disinformation and want to arm your kids with the skills and mindsets they need to discern fact from fiction and make good choices online, consider signing them up for an upcoming Virgils Fellowship cohort.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://virgils.io/\" target=\"_blank\">The next batch starts September 19th</a>.</p> ",

    "content": " <p><a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Work</a>&nbsp;has become a bit of a meme. While many executives and other knowledge workers are familiar with the term—and perhaps the praxis of deep work—few have incorporated it into their routines. Given the evidence for deep work’s goodness, the widespread availability of deep work “how-to’s,” the lip service paid to it by managers, and the fact that the digital age makes this more feasible than ever, the fact that it remains a rare phenomenon in the wild is rather odd.</p>\n\n<p>What explains this?</p>\n\n<p>I have sometimes found that when I present deep work as a concept to clients, friends, and colleagues, they generally like the sound of it. But when they realize the changes in their habits and routines it would necessitate, they begin to find the concept impractical (or even offensive).</p>\n\n<p>Some common objections:</p><ol><li><strong>“It’s not for me.”</strong>&nbsp;That’s true as long as you believe it.</li><li><strong>“There’s no way I could make four hours of uninterrupted deep work time in a single day, let alone four days a week. I have to be online available and urgently responding to incoming requests.”</strong>&nbsp;Unless you’re a salesperson or customer service representative, this is likely a self-imposed limiting belief&nbsp;<a href=\"https://annehelen.substack.com/p/larping-your-job\" target=\"_blank\">reinforced by video games masquerading as corporate communication software</a>. Even if you are a customer service representative or a salesperson, you should still be able to make deep work&nbsp;<em>work</em>&nbsp;because you will inevitably discover value-adding tasks that you can document and routinize.</li><li><strong>We are currently in crisis mode, i.e., “wartime.”</strong></li><li><strong>“I don’t even know what I should be doing during deep work time.”</strong></li></ol><p>Objections three and four are the subject of this essay.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that 3–4x 4-hour deep work chunks per week are the platonic ideal for digital market economy participants who care to thrive in the 21st century. During deep work time, you’re essentially investing in human capital–intensive assets and “developing bespoke technology” (this includes process design and does not need to be codified in machine language for it to be valuable). Asset (technology) development is the only moral way to create compounding value (which can accrue to you as a sole proprietor or the collective corporate entity to which you belong) and thus wealth. I am not aware of any alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>However, at a given time, whether you’re able to do deep work at all and the types of problems you should focus on are a function of your current environment. Particular limiting factors, which you can remove, are related to objections 3 and 4 above.</p>\n\n<p>To understand “where you are” (and thus what you can do about it), ask yourself the following questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Am I in wartime or peacetime?</strong></li><li>Do I know what I need to do, or <strong>have I wandered into a dark spot on the map?</strong></li></ol><h2>“We are in crisis mode…”</h2>\n\n<p>If it’s wartime, you must first “stop the bleeding”; then return to peacetime ASAP. Do this by putting structure around your work as quickly as possible. Tighten feedback loops between teammates. Introduce a sense of urgency into everything you do, especially the content and quality of your communication.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if there’s a system outage or one of your suppliers suddenly and unexpectedly went under, you need first to figure out how to fix the issues at hand. Spending four hours doing deep work would be irresponsible—<strong>you need to survive</strong>&nbsp;and then keep digging until you get to the root of the problem. That second part is critical if you want to return to and stay in peacetime. If, say, a recent update introduced a critical bug to your codebase, then, of course, the first thing you want to do is roll back the system to a previous version. But, you should also dedicate sufficient resources to understanding the root cause of the problem in the first place—not just in terms of code but also (and perhaps more ,
