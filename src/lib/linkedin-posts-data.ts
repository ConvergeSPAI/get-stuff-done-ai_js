I'd assume it's probably just built into the prompt: saying something like \"ask clarifying questions\" because I've had that work pretty well in the past. \n\"\nBut the impressive general solution to this would be that the system is able to somehow explicitly, or perhaps even intuitively at some level of scale, anticipate pockets of uncertainty that might be pre-emptively addressed by simply asking the user questions that get known facts about the world and then more importantly their intentions out of their head—which by itself is a major value add, especially for complex problems; it's not infrequently the case that the responsible person the responsible party might not even be totally sure what their goal is, let alone explicit acceptance or success criteria from which then challenges can be derived which the agent would have to focus on when doing its work asynchronously. \n\"\nBeing able to nail this up-front in a reliable manner is going to be a huge boon for all power users of this technology, especially as the reasoning models get both more powerful and access to your private data + a broader suite of specialized tools.\n\"\n\"Highly recommend taking this for a test drive — could be that we all just got an MBB analyst for $200/month!",

    "content": "o1 pro is just so good, oh my gosh.\"\n\"\nYou have to really think of it as an \"agent\" — give it lots of precise instruction, lots of context. Honestly, give yourself a good 1-5 minutes to simply think and articulate the thoughts that pop out of your head via a dictation tool like Wispr Flow or superwhisper and put it into o1 Pro along with whatever other salient digital records you can spin up. \n\"\nIt's not quite as snappy as using the other models, and this violates a bit of one of my good practices that I recommend to clients: \"speed is the name of the game\" when it comes to AI experiments. 5 minutes is long enough that you can go accomplish some other task in the meantime. With that amount of time comes expectations of higher quality which you can absolutely deliver on. But that means that you really need to think through what your ask is and can you provide the system with the relevant information so it can go think about it for you.\n\"\nTo give a very concrete example, I'm giving a presentation to some highly regulated industry C-levels in a few weeks. I had set up a voice assistant via Vapi to ask them/attendees a series of discovery questions and ended up generating 6 different long-form transcripts prior to even diving in and reading the transcripts sue or not. I popped it all into o1 Pro, gave it lots of context about what it was that I was trying to do with the presentation, how I'm thinking about this strategically, and frankly a lot of details that are just not documented or at least indexed and compressed in a way that I can copy and paste. Your intentions and goals are always somewhat latent, so I've found that it's incredibly important to verbally articulate those each time you use one of these systems (this is probably the no. 2 or 3 mistake I see users make — not clearly articulating their intent before hitting enter; this usually requires some deeper thinking by the user, but is a necessary \"literacy\" in the context of AI IMO). \n\"\nAnyway, it \"thought\" for about 4 minutes, and my goodness, am I blown away by the quality of the output here. \n\"\nWe're really moving up another level of the abstraction ladder: I didn't really have to specify a particular format or output structure that I wanted, and by not doing that, I gave it the flexibility to figure out the best way to present its findings in regard to what their top concern is and how I might be able to take the best next step in the context of what I'm trying to do. \n\"\nIt really does feel like you have a top-tier consulting firm analyst at your disposal for less than $10/day. \n\"\nCrazy stuff.\n\"\nYou just have to rethink the way that you're using these tools and optimize for quality while slowing down quite a bit at least compared to what you could do with previous model generations.\n\"\n\"Anyone else getting this kind of juice out of their Pro sub?",

Once again, I feel vindicated shelling out $200 a month for this package—frankly, I’d pay more, and eventually I expect to.\n\"\nFrom my phone in bed, I’ve already used Operator to:\n\"\n- Get event recommendations from GovConEvents AI (h/t Ron) by directing Operator to log into LinkedIn, grab my LinkedIn profile URL, and submit it. Operator even offered to register me automatically.\n\"\n- Create memes and post them to my bot account on Twitter using browser-based image manipulation tools.\n\"\n- Retrieve my latest Otter.ai meeting transcript entirely on its own, paste it into a new chat with Claude, and then prompt Claude to conduct a deep analysis for coaching opportunities in my role as the meeting facilitator.\n\"\nAs I try to understand what this means for my business and my clients', three main topics stand out:\n\"\n1. Security\n\"\nThese tools grow more valuable the more access they have to our data, which often means granting them persistent logins. That opens the door to potential vulnerabilities like prompt injection and jailbreaking.\n\"\nBut then again, people can be just as big an attack surface for cyber issues—think phishing or spear phishing. New research from OpenAI suggests that as system-two reasoning models get better, they might become more resilient to adversarial attacks. I do know, however, that the average human worker is not very resilient. Make of that what you will.\n\"\n2. Necessarily Evolving Norms (Especially in the Enterprise)\n\"\nAs I’ve written before, centralized IT is simply not a good fit for a world where AI capabilities evolve at such a rapid pace. Centralized IT often becomes a bottleneck, preventing employees—and therefore the organization—from realizing the full benefits of these tools.\n\"\nIf enterprises don’t proactively decentralize IT functions, top-tier talent (made 10x or 100x more productive by state-of-the-art AI products like Operator) will leave. That’s something that should keep CEOs up at night.\n\"\n3. Ethan Mollick's \"Jagged Frontier\n\"\nAI succeeds and fails in surprising ways; humans and AI each hold comparative advantages depending on the context and tasks at hand. Practically:\n\"\n- Unbundle roles. A traditional role is really a bundle of tasks, so break it down.\n\"\n- Delegate to AI. Offload the tasks where AI has a clear edge.\n\"\n- Re-bundle human roles so they handle everything else with maximal impact.\n\"\nIf humans are now only needed for (say) 10% of tasks in a 20th-century knowledge worker role—but they can do that 10% ten times more effectively when paired with advanced AI—then the overall value and scope of responsibility for each knowledge worker skyrockets.\n\"\nWhat next?\n\"\nGet hands-on with Operator yourself. \n\"\nDiscover via experimentation what was impossible yesterday that’s now possible, and then figure out how to use those new capabilities to make your customers 10x better off.\n\"\n\"Good luck!",

    "date": "2025-01-21",
    "content": "Ever wonder if generative AI can truly 10x your productivity—or if it’s just hype?\"\n\"\nFrom my experience, there’s one limiting factor and two bottlenecks you need to keep in mind—whether you’re in “single-player mode” (becoming the 10x version of your specialized role) or “multiplayer mode” (transforming how cross-functional teams and entire enterprises operate).\n\"\nLimiting Factor: Access to State-of-the-Art Models\n\"\nIf your team can’t use top-tier models—like o1 Pro or Sonnet 3.5—right away, you’re starting at a disadvantage.\n\"\nBottleneck #1: Getting Salient Context & High-Fidelity Data Into the Model\n\"\nI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: more is more. Meeting transcripts, CRM logs, support exchanges, code bases, knowledge articles, or social media threads—feeding your model with high-quality, proprietary data raises the odds of a meaningful first-turn output.\n\"\nYet most automated retrieval systems are still clunky. You end up hopping between apps, downloading or converting files, and copy/pasting text. That’s a tough sell for most people—unless they’ve already had that “magic moment,” where a task that used to take days (or weeks) gets done in a few hours. Once they see that, they’re hooked; until then, every extra click is a barrier.\n\"\nBottleneck #2: Getting Data Out of Your Head\n\"\nWe’ve been trained to type everything, but talking—literally speaking your thought process for 10 or 20 minutes—often prompts richer responses. The model can then engage in a true back-and-forth, helping you discover insights you might otherwise miss with short typed prompts.\n\"\nThe Dawn of Agentic Systems\n\"\nThis is especially relevant now that “agentic” AI—systems that do their own clicking, copying, and pasting—may arrive soon. Models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet already chain multiple steps: pulling code from a repository, running bash commands locally, capturing outputs, and using that info to decide on next steps before giving you a final result. It’s surprisingly capable if you set it up properly (e.g., Claude Desktop, new MCP servers).\n\"\nImplications for Enterprises\n\"\nAs these agentic tools mature, the gap widens between those who leverage them (orchestrating AI at a high level) and those stuck in old-school knowledge workflows. My biggest concern is that centralized IT in many enterprises moves too slowly, risking the loss of top talent who want more flexible, efficient tools.\n\"\nIn my view, this is the real bottleneck to achieving “true multiplayer mode” with AI: slow, centralized IT. Ironically, IT might be the first department in need of radical reform.\n\"\n\"Where do you see AI making the biggest impact in your organization—or your career?

As our networks become even more connected via AI-driven research and facilitation of high-quality introductions, the accelerated growth playbooks that prioritize quality over quantity become more feasible.\n\"\n2.\tData Sharing & Redaction \n\"\nAs AI tools get more capable, they’ll see more of our sensitive information. We have to be strategic about what data we feed them (prompt injection and jailbreaking are both salient challenges, especially), and build workflows that protect any proprietary content or personal info.\n\"\n3. Preparing for Agentic AI\n\"\nThe real shift will come when AI moves from a “suggestion engine” to an actual agent—not only responsively, but even proactively handling multi-step tasks, booking travel, following up with leads, and even deciding when to escalate issues to humans.\n\"\nCurious to hear if others are prepping for agentic AI...\n\"\n\"What are you doing to integrate new tools or future-proof your teams?",

This happened last night when I caught up with one of my private alpha participants. He figured out a clever solution to a dilemma he faced. On one extreme, he had zero insight into meetings he didn't attend, and on the other, he was attending every meeting. The solution was to have employees use their Fireflies note-taker to join meetings. He could then find out important details through his daily pulse message and communicate with Spark, his AI chief of staff.\n\"\nHowever, there was another category he hadn't considered: meetings he might want to attend or get more visibility into immediately after, without being present for the entire duration. He realized he could send his Fireflies note-taker and give other attendees a heads up. This would trigger my product to send notes at the meeting level rather than waiting for all aggregation the next day.\n\"\n\"This brilliant little innovation is something I'm excited to share with my other customers.

Top performers will turn to shadow IT use if IT admins are not able to provide them with the tools they need to get their job done ten times faster. It’s critical that approval processes are at least sped up dramatically and, at best, fully decentralized. This is not necessarily in the short-term interest of IT leadership, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\"\nThree, when it comes to goal setting, quality is more important than quantity. Managers should be expected to work with their team to aim at goals that are a rung up the abstraction ladder. For example, no. of meetings booked versus simply more cold email outreach by frontline SDRs.\n\"\nAnd finally, if it's critical that all employees understand that by using AI., they are de facto stepping into managerial roles—something most knowledge workers have never done. With great power comes great responsibility. And so it needs to be made crystal clear—perhaps with a public example of accountability or two, as the organization is learning—that if you use AI to help you get work done, you are fully accountable for whatever actions you take or the consequences of the content you publish.\n\"\nThis means bigger upside, of course, for individual workers, but also greater risk, and they need to understand they have skin in the game both ways; this understanding leads to the development of new QA/QC processes, etc.\n\"\nWhat other AI-related topics might public company board members want to know about? \n\"\n\"Let me know in the comments.",

Maybe 18 months ago, I worked on a project with another applied AI SME & Melior CEO Ryan Markman, where we used large language models to map an ideal customer profile to all the unstructured data associated with each LinkedIn profile in a shared pool of a company's employees' connections. \n\"\nI honestly didn't think it was going to work much better than standard keyword search, but lo and behold, it ended up doubling their pipeline. \n\"\nWhat that told me was that there was a massive opportunity to use AI to make the network-based search process significantly easier. In practice, this would mean giving relatively less weight to traditional inbound and outbound connections and significantly more to sidebound or nearbound à la Crossbeam, since those trusted first-degree connections, especially happy customers, are so valuable. \n\"\nUntil now, the cost of figuring out who the second and third-degree connections are, that could yield a fruitful interaction, was quite expensive and often prohibitive. \n\"\nWith some help from George I even built something that took my own LinkedIn network and after every call (David I demoed for your group IIRC): I would take the transcript, popped it in, and it would automatically search through my connections to find exactly the right person for the other party to speak to, given their precise challenges in the transcripts. \n\"\nIt actually worked pretty well (hit rate was maybe 1 fruitful connection every 10 days) but became quite expensive b/c the price of GPT-4 was still quite high, and the models weren't quite good enough for daily workflow use. It's been over a year and the technology has improved significantly — and ta-da: Happenstance has arrived.\n\"\nGiven that Y Combinator companies tend to be quite good, I expect that these guys will figure out something pretty important.\n\"\nAll that said, I'm definitely going to experiment with it and report back on the results. \n\"\nSpecifically, I'll be: \n\"\n1. searching through my network after every call by \n2. popping the Fireflies.ai transcript into ChatGPT Pro to \n3. identify the other person's top unmet need (latent or made explicit) and \n4. articulate the abstract persona I’d want to search for among my first and second-degree connections who would most likely be able to help the person I just spoke with, and perhaps even \n5. draft an intro email if it makes sense.\n\"\n\"If you'd like to give this a go yourself, in the interim, you can join my network via the link in the comments.",

In light of computers that can read, write, and reason, it should be self-evident that these roles will necessarily be unbundled, and the tasks of which they are comprised delegated accordingly, many to machines that can now handle them. The overall process is then decomposed into new bundles that may, at first, seem rather alien.\n\"\nYes, this way of working looks different than what we've gotten used to in the 20th century. Yes, this presents challenges, especially for people who derive a lot of self-worth from their ability to primarily do something a certain way, with the outcome being secondary. \n\"\nJust embrace it. Everyone has access to the technology.\n\"\nWith the release of the reasoning models, it's not that there might be wage deflation in traditional white-collar roles. There already is deflation, just not widely diffused. The rate at which this happens is largely a consequence of macroeconomic factors and policy issues outside the scope of this post. However, this overall trajectory is significantly less uncertain than it was even a year ago.\n\"\nIf you thought that by getting on a particular career track, you would be guaranteed some sort of income by doing things in a certain way, then I'm sorry. The reality is quite different, and with happiness being something like reality minus expectations, this will be the source of some tribulation.\n\"\nHowever, what I can guarantee you is that on the other side of a radical retooling effort, your real wages, degrees of freedom, and overall energy levels will be significantly higher. But this all starts with the realization that you don't deserve a single thing, especially in a relatively free global market.\n\"\nTo make meaningful progress, you must anchor your \"objective function\" to some other person's satisfaction that a real problem they have—a barrier in the way of attaining their own good goals—has been satisfactorily removed by you through a combination of technology and action. Get the reps in, and you will generate new expertise that will allow you to differentiate yourself, which is the source of wage appreciation and profit.\n\"\n\"Fate leads the willing and drags the unwilling.

Record all of your meetings with eg @firefliesai, and on a weekly basis, set a recurring 2-hour block (Friday mornings are good), where you select the best 3–5 meetings from the week, pop the transcripts into o1 Pro or Claude, and ask it to hit you with \"three extremely precise, hard-hitting follow-up questions—as if you were an expert journalist—that refer to the primary source material where appropriate, and if sufficiently addressed would be most likely to elicit some genuinely fruitful insight\" (or something like that). Go for a long walk, throw in the AirPods, turn on the voice memo app, and peek at each question, answering them via monologue until you're satisfied with where you land. Iterate by pasting what you say into the chat.\n\"\nUsually takes twenty or so minutes of spoken thought to get somewhere interesting in my experience. Take the transcript and work with AI to turn it into a little post or two you can publish or schedule.\n\"\n2. Hire a human thought partner to meet with you at some cadence and record a \"private podcast\" you can mine for additional content. This person should be aware of your overarching goals, be fun to speak with, and will cost more than Claude of course but I would recommend.\n\"\nThere's a third emerging growth mechanism I'm going to try soon via @spark_powerline on X — imbuing your core product value prop into a clearly AI-based persona (possibly with access to custom tooling and your proprietary data asset) that provides the tiniest bit of help with a succinct question or one-liner in response to an explicit or implicit need latent in a post. I expect that this could actually work pretty well, and the compute spend would be justified since it allows you to put hundreds of low hours ands to work at the top of the funnel, a spend amount that would have been basically useless with ads or even a human social manager.

I hated even the thought of posting on social maybe 3 years ago, but got over it with a combination of reps and approaching it with a mindset of \"I'm only going to post if it energizes me; I don't care what people think.\" \n\"\nThe key here is generating raw material to meditate on in the first place. You do this via the development process I described earlier (or, as an antecedent, consulting engagements where you cultivate expertise that you can bake into a product — took me ~18 months to take my consulting rate from $85 to $1000 / hr, and I may post about that process in the future...); solving others' problems in private makes for great discoveries to yap about in public...\n\"\n\"(Pt. 2 linked in comments...)",

    "content": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how to create a truly externally-facing AI presence that doesn’t just imitate old-school methods. There are basically three approaches I’ve seen so far:\"\n\"\n1.\tWebsite Chatbots\n\"\nYou can drop a chatbot on your homepage—but, it never quite feels right. Most of the time, it’s just an annoying pop-up that interrupts a user who’s trying to read or navigate.\n\"\n2.\tClones\n\"\nYou build an AI persona that's a stand-in for “you,” fielding inbound questions at scale. It can handle repetitive FAQs, but unless you have a massive audience, it's hard to justify the UX tradeoff: the models aren't quite there when it comes to getting your \"vibe\" across, and while that gap will close as the core tech gets better, there may end up being a pretty deep uncanny valley.\n\"\n3.\tA New Way? (Outbound & Helpful)\n\"\nInstead of automating your voice to trick people into thinking they’re talking to a human (the worst of this being pseudo-personalized email & LinkedIn spam), why not design an AI persona from scratch—something that transparently shows up as a helpful assistant when folks post about the very topics you’re great at?\n\"\nThis “third way” is about a new kind of relationship-building:\n\"\n\t•\tThe AI assistant engages in a right-sized, context-aware way.\n\t•\tIt’s clearly labeled as a bot, so no one feels duped.\n\t•\tIt offers real value—maybe asks a clarifying question or shares a relevant tip—just enough to build a modicum of trust.\n\"\nThe hope is that people see this AI persona, realize it’s genuinely helpful, and then decide to learn more about what you (and your product or service) can do. It’s a fresh approach that avoids the spammy “carnival barker” vibe & allows you to scale your know-how a bit by taking you out of the loop (key insight here: instant replies to posts have EXTREMELY high response rates; being able to close the loop in a few seconds rather than a few hours, let alone a few days is produces qualitatively different results, and this is only really possible if you delegate some small action to intelligent, discursive, semi-autonomous media).\n\"\nI’m actually spinning up this concept for Powerline’s “Spark”—the remote team CEO's AI chief-of-staff. It’ll go out on Twitter in the near future, interact thoughtfully with people who seem to need a little help, and (hopefully) nurture those relationships in a way that’s both human-friendly and scalable.\n\"\nAll of this goes back to my core belief in quality over quantity—not churning out more meaningless content, AKA \"LLM slop,\" or “faking it” online, but reimagining how AI can genuinely enhance conversations. I’ll report back on the results once it’s live.\n\"\nMark Amtower, thanks again for the lively discussion that got this out of my head...\n\"\n\"(If you’re curious, I’ll drop a link in the comments to some of the discussion that sparked this idea!)",

    "title": "From Resistance to Results: Three Practical Benefits of Using AI Note-Takers Like Fireflies",
    "date": "2024-12-20",
    "content": " <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4E12AQHdLmO9LUNqfA\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"> <p>As I spoke about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markamtower?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAADZO0B232BL7ofYVNNlcbJIbc34kDoRfk\">Mark Amtower</a> this morning, in the world of government contracting (GovCon) and beyond, <em>operational efficiency</em> often hinges on a delicate balance: driving innovation forward while respecting organizational culture, workflows, and stakeholder concerns. When it comes to adopting AI-driven meeting tools—like my personal favorite, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/fireflies-inc/\">Fireflies.ai</a>, a note-taking and transcription assistant—this balance can feel especially tricky. Employees may worry about privacy, added complexity to their existing workflows, or feeling “surveilled,” even if the tool’s purpose is to help everyone operate at a higher level.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, I’ve found that the key to smooth adoption isn’t to simply enforce top-down mandates, but to highlight clear, personal benefits that resonate with individuals, especially those on the front lines of customer engagement. If you can help that first customer-facing employee see the upside, you’ll build the trust and momentum you need for broader organizational buy-in — and to realize outsized value from <a href=\"https://powerline.bot\" target=\"_blank\">c-suite AI tools like POWERLINE</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here are three ways an AI note-taker can deliver immediate wins:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Faster Follow-Up and Reduced Busywork</strong></p>\n\n<p>We’ve all been there—after a detailed conversation with a client or a prospect, you’ve got to scramble to produce accurate call summaries, draft follow-up emails, or log action items into the CRM. AI note-takers remove much of this burden by transcribing the meeting in real time. That means the attendee can focus on being present and responsive during the call rather than scribbling down notes. Post-meeting, generating polished follow-up emails or extracting key action items from a transcript is as quick and seamless as popping the transcript into a state-of-the-art AI tool like ChatGPT or Claude. The result? Less time lost to busywork and a faster, higher-quality response to the customer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Seamless Compliance and Reporting</strong></p>\n\n<p>For many organizations, especially in GovCon, maintaining compliance and navigating complex contractual requirements can be a huge lift. Instead of manually transferring notes into a compliance log or a database, AI tools help automate that process. With a searchable transcript, employees can quickly find the details they need, confirm compliance steps, and generate the necessary documentation. This makes internal audits and reporting a breeze, freeing up time and cognitive bandwidth for more strategic tasks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Continuous Improvement Through Coaching and Insight</strong></p>\n\n<p>Think of AI-generated transcripts as a coaching resource. After a meeting, employees can review what was said, when it was said, and how the conversation flowed. Paired with AI-driven analysis, teams can identify patterns, spot opportunities, and refine messaging strategies. In a sales or client management setting, this may mean quickly detecting common objections, discovering which talking points resonate most, or highlighting cross-sell opportunities. Over time, your team isn’t just saving effort—they’re actually growing more effective, honing their skills, and improving client relationships, and with minimal managerial overhead!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Starting Small, Building Momentum</strong></p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this approach is that you don’t have to push everyone onto the platform at once. Start with one or two customer-facing staff who are open to testing the tool. Help them leverage the time savings, compliance benefits, and coaching insights. As they experience the tangible value—less scramble after calls, smoother handoffs, and improved client outcomes—their enthusiasm naturally spreads. Their peers start to ask, “How can I get in on this?” Instead of a top-down command, you’ve created a bottom-up pull for AI-driven efficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Model for Broader Change</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although we’re focusing on Fireflies and meeting transcription here, these principles apply to other AI-enabled transformations. Organizations facing uncertain times, whether in public or private sectors, thrive when they align technology adoption with frontline needs. By showing people a concrete benefit in their day-to-day work, you reduce friction and build a foundation (via a durable <strong>data asset</strong> and new organizational <em>know-how</em>) for more ambitious operational improvements down the line.</p>\n\n<p>As year-end approaches and many of us reconsider our tech stacks and productivity tools, now might be the perfect time to experiment. <a href=\"https://fireflies.ai\" target=\"_blank\">Try AI note-taking for a single meeting.</a> See if it slashes the follow-up hassle. Gauge the improvement in accuracy and turnaround. If it works, you’ve got a blueprint for rolling out other smart tools that don’t just record what’s said—they help everyone become better at what they do.</p> ",

and</p></li><li><p>commands a nice premium over traditional SaaS seat-based licenses by trading a massive reduction in marginal clicks for high-3-to-even-4-figures of revenue per month (particularly relevant: the perennial <a target=\"_blank\">Stratechery</a> insight in re the relative impossibility of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2010/apple-innovators-dilemma/?t\" target=\"_blank\">\"overshooting\" good UX</a>).</p></li></ol><p>Three possible instantiations of the above (yes, this is an explicit invitation to build these—I would pay a premium for all three!):</p><ol><li><p>a \"<strong>business developer</strong>\" that facilitates fruitful connections via deep, deep research prior to bidding for the principal's limited attention (related: one of the main bottlenecks going forward will be human attention, i.e., the rate of improvement of context window length is surely greater than our own, or <em>we're all executives now</em>); an MVP of this might be a <strong>matchmaking system</strong> that facilitates the fewest, most surprising connections between conference attendees prior to the event given some publicly available information about the ticketholders and a modicum of information in re their goals, what's salient, etc., all of which can be elicited during a short phone conversation via a voice assistant like <a target=\"_blank\">Vapi</a>;</p></li><li><p>a \"<strong>recruiter</strong>\" that does search across not-only-human candidates and even breaks the FTE/contractor models by default: Given some rich data (again, let's say, meeting or call transcripts), this flavor of agentic system should be able to d<strong>erive the no. 1 problem their principal faces</strong> (I can tell you from experience, by the way, that this is often latent in the unstructured source material, not apparent those who face the problem, but <strong>legible to state-of-the-art foundation models</strong>), performs a massively broad search across specialist software solutions (which could be products for people or <strong>tools for agents</strong> with deeper access to their principal's secrets), hyper-differentiated individual SMEs (i.e., AI-powered services solopreneurs, which is already emerging labor category...I know this, in part, <em>because I am one</em>) who are open to outcome-based compensation, and then, on the margin, your more traditional specialist shops/agencies or—GASP—a part- or full-time hire; and</p></li><li><p>an \"<strong>aligned curator</strong>\" that produces some kind of <strong>anti-mimetic content feed</strong>: Instead of hoovering up attention by prioritizing <em>socially proven</em> content that hooks directly into our lizard brains à la the web2 behemoths, what if your open-ended discovery agent (see also: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective/dp/3319155237\" target=\"_blank\">Ken Stanley's work</a>) could go deeper and deeper into an untrodden pocket of latent space, generating hypotheses and even counterintuitive insights for you to meditate on, say, a weekly basis? I'm talking <em>actual personalization</em> (in the sense of personalism and <a href=\"https://primematters.com/foundations/search-truth/studiositas-and-curiositas\" target=\"_blank\"><em>studiositas</em></a> vs. the potent combination of pride/envy/curiositas that drives so much digital media consumption at the moment).</p></li></ol><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/perplexity-ai/\">Perplexity</a>, Google's new Gemini <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Research</a> product, and o1 with <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/o1-and-new-tools-for-developers/\" target=\"_blank\">tools and variable TTC</a> are great first steps.</p>\n\n<p>I look forward to seeing how entrepreneurs, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_if-theres-one-thing-you-commit-to-in-2025-activity-7274438151656411136-9kNH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>including and especially YOU!</strong></a>, take the aforementioned capabilities to the next level in '25—and reporting back on what I learn as I integrate these nascent, next-gen AI capabilities deeper into my and my clients' workflows, all the way from <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerated-ai-adoption-christian-ulstrup-9wgke/\" target=\"_blank\">single-player to multiplayer modes</a>.</p> ",

Which tasks or projects do you delegate, and how do you tailor the engagements, and especially compensation, accordingly?);\n\"\n- who exactly are those 1–5% of individuals in your organization who can be invited to form the core cross-functional team that moves the entire thing forward post-transformation? (My guess is that they can come from any \"level\" as the corporate forms of the future may come to resemble more fluid networks vs. rigid hierarchies)\n\"\nThe key takeaway?\n\"\nYou need to run experiments to find out!\n\"\n\"Arm your people with the tools, point them toward good goals, and embrace change—as you venture out on the frontier and discover exactly those things that are possible that were literally impossible a few months ago, the answers to these questions will become more clear...",

    "content": "I suspect that as AI becomes a real substitute for labor, a larger percentage of tasks that were previously bundled into 20th-century bureaucratic jobs will be rebundled into new jobs and a new type of software product. \"\n\"\nThese new products will not quite resemble consumer software or enterprise SaaS. \n\"\nInstead of hiring someone for $100,000 a year, as a productive solopreneur, you might \"hire\" two to ten specialized software products that each cost hundreds or low thousands of dollars a month (digital alternatives for 1/100 to 1/10 the cost that are 50-80% as good...and work 24:7!) — software profit margins will converge with services, BUT fixed costs will fall, relatively (some might argue this is already the case as servicing enterprise SaaS customers is actually pretty labor intensive, and those costs are somewhat wrongly assigned to SGA, S&M, R&D, etc.).\n\"\nI think this is more likely than having one assistant to rule them all; that said, I am exited about Operator, et cetera (et al?).\n\"\nWhile some may choose to consolidate their digital interactions to one or two AI delegates, the more entrepreneurial among us will probably maintain a much more fragmented set of interactions. \n\"\nYou may have your \"AI executive team,\" with functional specialties and perhaps a \"chief of staff\" or even multiple. \n\"\nAdditionally, there could be numerous levels where you're interfacing directly with external customers more frequently for tough problems, or even with their delegates, depending on your position in the capital stack — and taking action at different levels in a single day. More like being a central node in a fluid network than (exclusively) a chief executive atop a hierarchy.\n\"\nThis future is neither dystopian nor utopian. \n\"\n(And much of how things were done in the 20th and early 21st centuries may not change significantly. I wouldn't be surprised if by the 22nd century, there were still people using fax machines or texting with their thumbs.)\n\"\nHowever, toward the expanding frontier, there will be a Cambrian explosion of configurations regarding how you participate in the global economy. \n\"\nThis will involve a lot of creative experimentation with the information technology scaffolding around yourself and between yourself and collaborators and customers; this is happening now if you know where to look.\n\"\nI don't think it’s particularly useful to make predictions about the future with a \"good\" or \"bad\" valence. \n\"\nWhat's likely is the \"weird and alien\" dials will get cranked up for many folks, especially the younger Gen Zs & Alphas, as they start entering the unconventional workforce that exists aside tracked careers — some of those details are actually worth meditating on, but are a bit harder to think about + are uncharismatic, so posting about them gets ltd attention, because they share little context with the present ways of working.\n\"\nI'd like to see more of these posts, personally...\n\"\n\"What are some emerging norms you're seeing downstream of AI adoption?",

How can you scale these capabilities so that entire teams, departments, and eventually your whole enterprise benefit?</p>\n\n<p>To answer this, I’ve developed a \"scale invariant*\" three-level <em>Accelerated AI Adoption</em> Maturity Model. This framework shows you how to evolve from individual experimentation (single-player mode) to organization-wide transformation (multiplayer mode). By progressing through these levels, you’ll cultivate a more adaptive, open, and continuously improving culture—one that thrives on user-led innovation and seizes new value streams at every turn.</p><blockquote><p>*it works for organizations of any size: from bootstrapped indie founders to massive enterprises</p></blockquote><p><strong>Level 1: Individual Productivity & Data Asset Creation</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Maximize personal efficiency with AI, while generating rich data assets that set the stage for more complex workflows later.</p>\n\n<p>At this initial stage, the focus is on you—your own productivity, learning curve, and personal data workflow. <strong>Core capabilities</strong> include:</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Speech-to-Text Dictation:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Stop typing, start talking.</em> Use tools like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/superwhisper/\">superwhisper</a> (or, if you must, OS built-in dictation) to get your thoughts into the machine rapidly, providing high-context input to AI systems. This accelerates your brainstorming and helps you think in real-time with your AI “thought partner”; unlike Google Search, the key to getting the most out of these systems is, \"more is more,\" meaning get as much salient context out of your head as quickly as you can and then into the AI system (vs. the three-keyword web search queries we've become accustomed to carefully crafting over the past two decades).</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>General-Purpose AI Chat Interfaces:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tools like ChatGPT (especially the new Pro / Teams offerings) or Anthropic’s Claude equivalents serve as your personal AI assistant. They can help you rewrite text, draft memos, generate new ideas, or parse complex documents; this technology is truly one of those rare (maybe once in a century?) general purpose technologies that unlock qualitative changes in both <em>what's feasible</em> and <em>how work gets done</em>. Start with a basic subscription and level up as you become a heavier user.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Automated Meeting Note-Takers:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Capture all your discussions with a tool like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/fireflies-inc/\">Fireflies.ai</a>. Recording conversations and making them searchable transforms transient meetings into long-lasting data assets; as I mentioned before, more is more, so the more salient data you have (and these raw primary sources are absolute <strong>gold</strong>, especially as the models get smarter, allowing them to perceive meaningful insight contained therein, not unlike a digital microscope), the more you'll get out of the general purpose tools à la Chat. Cultivate a habit of feeding this trove of transcripts into AI models for analysis, insights, and acceleration. </p>\n\n<p>A great way to get started is to pipe a transcript into the most powerful you have access to after a meeting, and ask it to 1) act as your trusted advisor and give feedback, 2) draft a follow-up email, and 3) suggest an action item that no-one explicitly mentioned that you can perform in 60 seconds or less.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Personal productivity skyrockets, but more importantly, you accumulate a “data asset”—a record of your processes, problem-solving logic, and decision-making. This data pool becomes the raw material for more complex forms of AI adoption down the line.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Level 2: Asynchronous, Remote & Fractional Collaboration</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Move from single-player efficiency to multiplayer mode, where small teams, fractional talent, and global collaborators work together asynchronously, mediated by AI.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you’ve mastered personal productivity, it’s time to extend these benefits to a broader network. Think of Level 2 as building a distributed team of humans and AIs working together seamlessly; it can happen internally b/w FTEs or externally, via semi-porous, AI-mediated interactions with hyper-specialized contractors (like me) and, e.g., global talent you can spin up for ad hoc tasks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Steps & Tools:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/useloom/\">Loom</a> to record quick video updates and Slack (or Teams) for distributed collaboration. Asynchronous communication allows people to work across time zones and reduces the drag of status meetings.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Fractional Labor & Expert Networks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tap platforms like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/upwork/\">Upwork</a> to find on-demand experts who can handle specialized tasks that AI can’t fully automate yet. Rather than hiring another full-time team member, you assemble a flexible constellation of talent as needed.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Building Your Digital Presence:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I highly recommend taking right-sized steps toward cultivating a rich professional footprint on LinkedIn: share insights, build credibility, and attract collaborators. For more informal, niche interests, platforms like X (formerly Twitter) can help you connect with other intrinsically motivated internet explorers; I personally get a lot of value from using X like a notebook, rather than a marketing channel per se. While this doesn't replace traditional networking or the deep, trust-based relationships that are the foundation of a scalable and business, they do complement those activities by allowing the people in your network to engage with you and your ideas in a low-cost, async, remote, and incremental way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You transcend individual productivity. AI plus human collaborators form a fluid, adaptive team. Communication flows across continents and time zones (and cultures!). Your public presence and credibility grow, adding intangible assets—reputation, a global network—that feed back into your efficiency and opportunities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Level 3: Bespoke Software Development & Capital Creation</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Convert your accumulated data and expertise into digital capital assets—custom software tools that encapsulate your know-how and solve high-value problems.</p>\n\n<p>At Level 3, you’re not just using AI-powered tools; you’re creating them (and maybe selling access!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Steps & Tools:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>AI-Augmented Software Development:</strong></p>\n\n<p>With tools like o1 Pro (just released last week; believe me, the $200/mo price tag is still a steal) and/or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/repl-it/\">Replit</a>, you can prototype, build, and host custom applications quickly. AI co-pilots assist with coding, testing, and refining features, dramatically reducing development cycles.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Custom Integrations & APIs:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Connect different APIs and services to build tailored workflows that solve specific, high-value challenges. You’re now orchestrating technology at a higher level of abstraction, stitching components together on-the-fly.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Monetization & Capital Asset Creation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your proprietary data, codified into software, becomes a revenue-generating asset. You can target a niche of premium clients or go broad-market, but either way, you’re turning your unique expertise into digital capital that scales — Stripe is easier than ever to set up, and you'd do yourself (and your existing customers) a huge service by encoding your unique expertise into always-on SaaS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You’ve fully embraced the 21st-century digital economy. AI isn’t just a tool for crafting emails and summarizing documents—it’s a multiplier for your personal and organizational value. You own software assets that produce ongoing returns, raising your leverage and financial upside.</p>\n\n<h2>From Single-Player to Multiplayer: Cultivating Organizational Transformation</h2>\n\n<p>While the maturity model traces a clear vertical path—personal productivity, a new kind of \"liquid team\"–based coordination, and asset creation—another dimension is the shift from single-player to multiplayer mode <em>across the organization</em>. The real transformative leap happens when entire departments (or new emergent structures that smash through silos) and whole enterprises adopt AI-assisted workflows.</p>\n\n<p>This shift often defies expectation. At Level 1, you’re flying solo. By Level 2, you’ve integrated AI with human collaborators, freelancers, and global talent. By Level 3, you’re building proprietary tools. Across these stages, you evolve from isolated innovation to collective progress—and that collective process (by which true collective <em>learning</em> can be achieved) is the essence of <em>multiplayer mode</em>: a culture where everyone is empowered by and with AI, continuously learning from each other’s breakthroughs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why This Matters for Organizations of All Sizes</strong></p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this model is that it’s scale-invariant. Whether you’re a solo entrepreneur or leading a Fortune 500 giant, the underlying principles remain constant; that said, AI integration into an existing enterprise with legacy IT, formal processes, career progression tracks, compensation bands, norms, artifacts, etc. comes with a slew of challenges (making change management up to 3x more expensive vs. previous IT innovation waves). Here's what you should do if you want to integrate the technology and achieve actually transformative results:</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Adopt the Tools, Don’t Ban Them:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Give everyone meaningful access to AI tools (some variation of those listed above). Prohibiting these tools only pushes usage underground and risks losing control over data flows. By providing secure, approved, enterprise-grade access, you encourage responsible experimentation.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>From Shadow IT to Show-and-Tell:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many “power users” already exist in your organization. They’re the 1-5% who have quietly figured out how to leverage AI to multiply their productivity. Bring them into the spotlight. Host weekly show-and-tell sessions where they share breakthroughs. Record these sessions, build a knowledge repository, and turn private expertise into a shared asset.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Embrace Remote-First, Asynchronous Collaboration:</strong></p>\n\n<p>AI thrives in distributed networks; the companies that are doubling down on RTO initiatives will miss out on the upside, since the constraints that make AI use make more sense (and thus stimulate learning—necessity is the mother of invention after all) won't be in place to generate new know-how. Time zones matter less. Expertise is a Slack message or Loom video away. Outsource tasks on-demand to fractional talent (e.g., via Upwork; Replit bounties are another good option). This mode of operation accelerates learning and creates a culture of continuous improvement.</p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>Rethink Roles, Responsibilities, and Incentives:</strong></p>\n\n<p>High-performing AI adopters won’t just be more productive; they’ll integrate strategy, execution, and quality control into a fluid workflow. Traditional role definitions may become obsolete. Embrace this tension and use it as a catalyst to redesign teams, create new career paths, and redefine incentives that reward innovation and knowledge sharing.</p>\n\n<p>5. <strong>Marry Bottom-Up Innovation with Top-Down Ambition:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Over time, grassroots user-led innovation and leadership-driven strategic goals should converge. Top-down targets (e.g., double qualified leads, halve project timelines) become achievable as AI-fluent teams experiment, iterate, and learn rapidly. The result is not just incremental improvements—it’s a fundamental shift in how work gets done.</p>\n\n<p>If you really want to go deep on this, check out my \"One Objective to Rule Them All\" approach to driving transformational change with cross-functional teams; it's a perfect complement to AI adoption, and formalizing the pursuit of a highly visible (and somewhat uncertain) strategic initiative will further catalyze the rate at which you reap the benefits of the AAA approach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A New Kind of Organizational Capital</strong></p>\n\n<p>As the maturity model and show-and-tell culture scale, you accumulate a new form of “organizational capital.” It’s not just intellectual property or customer relationships—though those matter. It’s the collective know-how, artifacts, transcripts, and demos your people produce as they learn in public. New hires onboard faster because they have a rich tapestry of best practices to reference. Employees feel more confident trying new workflows because they see peers succeeding.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, these processes, recordings, and shared insights become a durable competitive advantage. You’re not just “doing AI” in a corner—you’re building an organization that learns constantly, adapts easily, and redeploys its expertise at will.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Level 1:</strong> Supercharge personal productivity and accumulate data assets.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Level 2:</strong> Expand your capabilities across asynchronous, global teams.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Level 3:</strong> Build custom software solutions that transform your expertise into digital capital.</p>\n\n<p>Overlay this vertical maturity model with the horizontal shift from single-player to multiplayer mode. Start with a few AI power users, embrace show-and-tell sessions to share their breakthroughs, then formalize cross-functional “tiger teams” to tackle ambitious organizational goals. The result? A culture that doesn’t just keep pace with technological change—it sets the pace.</p>\n\n<p>Generative AI is the biggest work paradigm shift since the internet. Those who master these levels and embrace the multiplayer mindset won’t just boost productivity; they’ll redefine the rules of competition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And now is the time to act</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you’d like to learn more about implementing this model or discuss private working sessions to jumpstart your journey, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and/or send me a DM.</p></blockquote> ",

    "content": "Had an eye-opening conversation yesterday about why large organizations struggle with AI transformation, despite the clear potential for 10x productivity gains. \"\n\"\nIt reminded me of a fascinating parallel from history: the adoption of electricity in factories.\n\"\nInitially, companies simply retrofitted their old factories with electrical power, seeing only incremental gains. The real revolution came when factories were fundamentally redesigned around electricity's capabilities. \n\"\nSound familiar?\n\"\nToday's large organizations face a similar crossroads with AI. \n\"\nThrough my conversations with leaders across industries, I've identified two critical barriers:\n\"\nFirst, the structural challenge: Multiple management layers and slow, politically-charged goal-setting processes dilute any sense of urgency for transformation. When you're several layers removed from strategic decision-making, it's hard to feel empowered to drive radical change.\n\"\nSecond, the compensation barrier: Traditional, rigid leveling systems discourage innovation. When your compensation is banded regardless of output, where's the incentive to achieve that 10x productivity gain? I'm seeing talented employees who master AI tools either quietly reducing their workload or leaving for more dynamic environments.\n\"\nHere's the reality: The path to successful AI transformation isn't about broadly deploying tools like Copilot and hoping for an aggregate 10% productivity boost. It's about identifying and empowering the 1-5% of employees who can drive exponential gains. These champions typically share key traits: intellectual humility, deep curiosity, high verbal intelligence, and enough experience to know what \"good\" looks like without being set in their ways.\n\"\nThe winning strategy? It's threefold:\n\"\n1. Provide universal access to general-purpose AI tools (e.g., Fireflies.ai, superwhisper, Claude)\n2. Create forums for knowledge sharing (e.g., weekly show-and-tells)\n3. Formalize cross-functional teams around your identified champions to tackle mission-critical initiatives\n\"\n4.\" Optional, but highly recommended: Stay in the loop (and address risks/seize opportunities) by installing AI-powered eyes & ears across the org with https://powerline.bot\n\"\nBut, remember — none of this works long-term without rethinking compensation structures: i.e., moving from rigid, leveled systems to outcome-based rewards that incentivize innovation and productivity gains.\n\"\nThe stakes are high. Companies that cling to 20th-century organizational structures while implementing 21st-century tools risk alienating their best talent. \n\"\nUnlike the physical constraints of the industrial revolution, today's digital landscape allows for rapid, radical transformation of value chains—if you have the courage to pursue it.\n\"\nWhat's your experience with AI transformation in large organizations? Are you seeing similar patterns? Let's discuss in the comments.\n\"\n\"#AITransformation #OrganizationalChange #Innovation #Leadership #FutureOfWork",

    "date": "2024-11-26",
    "content": " <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4E12AQGMtEUdIgpN8Q\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"> <p>Remember the last time you sat down with a truly exceptional advisor or mentor? They didn't just wait for you to ask questions. Instead, they asked you the kind of penetrating questions that helped clarify your thinking and unlock new insights. This is exactly where search engines are headed—and it's going to transform how we interact with information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Limitations of Today's Search</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our current relationship with search engines (and tools for traversing information space, which I'd use more broadly to include LLM-powered tools like ChatGPT) is fundamentally reactive. We type in queries, and they respond with a list of potentially relevant results. This approach puts the entire burden of asking the right questions on us. </p>\n\n<p>But what if we don't know what we don't know? What if we're missing critical context or approaching a problem from the wrong angle entirely?</p>\n\n<p>This limitation becomes particularly acute for executives and leaders dealing with complex decisions. When every minute counts, scrolling through search results and iteratively refining queries isn't just inefficient; it's a missed opportunity for deeper insight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Power of Being Asked the Right Questions</strong></p><blockquote><p>The search engines of the future will ask <em>you</em> questions...</p></blockquote><p>The right question at the right moment can stop you in your tracks. It can make you realize you've been focusing on the wrong problem, help you see a blind spot, or illuminate an opportunity you hadn't considered. This is why the best advisors, coaches, and mentors are masters at asking questions.</p>\n\n<p>Now, imagine having an AI-powered search engine that could do the same. Instead of passively waiting for your query, it would actively engage with you in a dialogue, drawing on its comprehensive understanding of your context, history, and goals—all while respecting every slice of your attention, not notifying you incessantly to develop a habit (or \"stickier\" product à la the social media platforms of the past 20 years), but rather distilling the remaining gaps between where you are and where you want to be into a perfectly-timed, personalized, punchy question.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What This Future Looks Like</strong></p>\n\n<p>Picture this: You open ChatGPT, Claude, Google, or any other internet portal, and instead of a blank search box, you're greeted with a thoughtful question about your most pressing business challenge. The system has already analyzed patterns in your recent activities, monitored relevant market trends, and identified potential opportunities or risks you should consider.</p>\n\n<p>(And, even better, you don't type a single key in response; you only need to speak your mind, and the system will begin engaging with you through spoken and auditory dialogue.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>For example:</strong></p><ul><li><blockquote><p>I noticed you've been researching supply chain optimization. Have you considered how recent changes in Asian manufacturing policies might impact your strategy?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Your team has been focused on customer acquisition, but the data suggests retention might be a more pressing issue. Should we explore why?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>There's an emerging trend in your industry that connects to a project you worked on last quarter. Would you like to understand the implications?</p></blockquote></li></ul><p><strong>Beyond Simple Information Retrieval</strong></p>\n\n<p>This evolution represents a fundamental shift from information retrieval to proactive, intelligent guidance. The search engine of the future will ask <em>you</em> questions, towards the following ends:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identifying Blind Spots</strong>: By proactively raising questions about areas you might have overlooked</p></li><li><p><strong>Challenging Assumptions</strong>: Through targeted questions that help you examine your premises</p></li><li><p><strong>Connecting Dots</strong>: By highlighting relationships between seemingly unrelated pieces of information</p></li><li><p><strong>Driving Action</strong>: By turning insights into concrete next steps, and making it easy for you to overcome inertia</p></li></ol><p><strong>The Organizational Impact</strong></p>\n\n<p>For businesses, this shift will be transformative. Instead of employees spending hours sifting through information, they'll engage in high-value dialogues with AI systems that help them arrive at better decisions faster. This is particularly crucial given recent studies showing that professionals spend an inordinate amount of time in unproductive information-gathering activities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What This Means for Leaders</strong></p>\n\n<p>For executives and decision-makers, this evolution in search technology will serve as a form of \"cognitive augmentation.\" It will help:</p><ul><li><p>Focus attention on what truly matters</p></li><li><p>Identify emerging opportunities and risks earlier</p></li><li><p>Make better-informed decisions faster</p></li><li><p>Stay ahead of market trends and changes</p></li></ul><h3>The Path Forward</h3>\n\n<p>This transformation won't happen overnight, but it's already beginning. The rapid advancement of large language models and AI systems that can engage in sophisticated reasoning is laying the groundwork for this future.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, we're already seeing early implementations of this vision in specialized domains. At <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/gsd-at-work/\">GSD at Work LLC</a> , we've been working on this exact problem for CEOs and executives through our new product <a href=\"https://powerline.bot\" target=\"_blank\">POWERLINE</a>, an AI chief-of-staff that proactively asks the right questions and surfaces critical insights from across your organization.</p>\n\n<p>The key to making these systems work is developing them in ways that:</p><ul><li><p>Build trust through consistently valuable insights</p></li><li><p>Respect privacy and security concerns</p></li><li><p>Integrate seamlessly with existing workflows</p></li><li><p>Provide transparent reasoning for their questions and suggestions</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>The search engines of the future won't just wait for your questions—they'll ask you the questions you should be asking yourself. This shift from reactive to proactive search will fundamentally change how we interact with information and make decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The winners in this new era will be those who embrace these systems not just as tools for finding information, but as partners in thinking, planning, and decision-making.

    "content": "I don't do didactic presentations on AI anymore. \"\n\"\nAnd if you're serious about adopting the tech, you shouldn't attend them — or, TBH, watch YouTube videos, purchase courses, etc., EXCEPT...\n\"\n...if it's in the context of you having already committed to producing something with the tools, something ambitious and under extreme time contraints that you literally could not have without AI.\n\"\nWhy not? \n\"\nPeople love webinars, presentations, podcast interviews, etc...and they're willing to shell out cash for them, especially at the corporate level!\n\"\nBecause it's not aligned with the actual objective of any of these exercises: to help people retool, either in the context of the organization they're currently a part of, or as they seek new opportunities and prepare to reenter this new 21st-century economy.\n\"\nPassive consumption of charismatic media gives you the false sense of progress — that you learned something that makes you feel a bit smarter, that you can pass along to colleagues to demonstrate your AI-savviness, that this \"AI thing\" is now a bit more within your control, and you're going to \"be ok\" (e.g., keep your job).\n\"\nUnfortunately, that feeling you get has very little to do with whether or not you're actually retooling. Passive consumption—or even meditating on the core content, even if it's high-quality—is not enough!\n\"\nYou have to actually do things! You need to TAKE ACTION!\n\"\n(And, especially at the beginning, it can be excruciatingly uncomfortable, especially if you're coming in with limiting beliefs like, \"I can't code!\")\n\"\nRemember, there are no experts in AI, only pioneers, and the dynamic nature of the technology is such that real gains can only be achieved through rapid experimentation in a domain that you find energizing and, if sufficiently navigated / ordered with the help of this technology, would lead to better outcomes for the customers and colleagues who benefit from your hard work.\n\"\nEspecially at the beginning of the retooling journey, much of the investment of energy and attention goes into \"muddling through\" the process of making something (again that was impossible to do given the same constraints) good; general principles, good practices, etc. emerge from that process, and some awareness of them prior may be helpful, but it's much better to learn in the course of a real project with acceptance criteria than devouring didactic media on its own.\n\"\nSo, if you're tempted to:\n\"\n- sign up for more newsletters,\n- watch YouTube tutorials,\n- scroll through X for the latest AI goss,\n- pay consultants for $X00,000 slideware,\n- hire an \"AI expert\" to do standardized company-wide training or seminars...\n\"\n...DON'T!\n\"\n\"Instead, scope a good goal, muster the energy to suffer through the process of clicking and typing and changing core habits until you've made something that a dispassionate third-party has verified is actually GOOD; only then will you gain the the tacit knowledge that makes it 10x easier to tackle the next task with AI.",

We are entering a volatile period—which may last decades—due to changes in technology, climate, and global demographics. As was discussed by one speaker, as \"offense can be the best defense\" in high-vol environments, what might that mean for leaders of institutions, especially those operating in a global context, when it comes to choosing between either a generally proactive or responsive stance? Related: might AI be useful as a means of reducing uncertainty, e.g., by simulating high-stakes negotiations with Delphi clones, and enabling generally tighter OODA loops?\n\"\n2. Quantum computing isn't ready for prime time...and may not be for quite a while. BUT, there's quite a bit of room for innovation between there and classical computing (which could yield huge gains in efficiency)—and we'll need it as demand for AI and energy skyrocket. Excited to follow Extropic as they execute on this opportunity.\n\"\n3. There's a meaningful (and seemingly growing!) appetite for innovation and the adoption of cutting-edge technology like AI by civil servants and policymakers. Bipartisan support for CHIPS is a positive sign.\n\"\n\"Bob and Matthew have done a fantastic job building bridges between DC and the pioneers on technology frontier, and I can't wait to attend again in '25.",

Currently, I'm talking about an outcome that can be achieved within maybe one to five interactions; but, we should expect the scope of what can be delegated/computed without intervention to expand — so, interacting with these systems may become more like meeting with your team at a daily stand-up or weekly objective and key results meeting to pursue, perhaps even in the context of a more ambitious goal, and then dividing and conquering through delegation and reconvening once the experiments have been run or the work's been done according to those predefined and negotiated acceptance criteria.\n\"\n(The main difference will be that instead of \"10 medium-sized t-shirts\" worth of work getting done, it'll be more like 100 or even 1000 in the same period and for the same cost, where much of it goes into compute instead of labor per se.)\n\"\nThat's not to say you won't need to dive deep and open up your IDE if you're coding or review work product before publication. \n\"\nHowever, you will be able to get back a decent amount of time and attention that you can reinvest in higher levels of orchestration and grander goals. \n\"\n\"This is something to be excited about if you enjoy working with and especially managing cross-functional teams under conditions of uncertainty!",

    "content": "I am incredibly honored to have been a part of making year's MIT AI Conference happen for the first time in New York. \"\n\"\nIt was a joy working with the volunteer team to make this a reality over the past year.\n\"\nOur goal was to put on AI conference that's a little different from what you'd find elsewhere: In particular, there's a lot of charismatic speculation at the moment, both utopian and dystopian, about what might be coming down the pipeline due to AI. \n\"\nWhile I do love thinking about the future, we thought it was important to construct programs around sharing fresh, surprising, and practical insights with attendees—insights based on real data generated by AI pioneers across industries who have been integrating the technology into production workflows. \n\"\nI'm happy to say that we accomplished our objective.\n\"\nThat raises the question of what I found most practically insightful from the conference. I have to say it was the common thread across multiple technical founders from various industries, who, for the first in many years in some cases, were rolling up their sleeves again and writing code at speeds previously thought impossible (thanks to new models like O1 from OpenAI).\n\"\nThis experience gave me continued enthusiasm and motivation this week to keep working on a product I've been building in stealth for CEOs—a project that's, for now, essentially going from zero to one on my own (w/ some help from Chat and Claude).\n\"\nBroadly, the general takeaway is that for anybody who's been away from the front lines—whether you climbed the ranks in a technical organization, sales, or any other modern corporate function—there's no better time than the present to get your hands dirty again.\n\"\nLearning how to apply this technology to solve problems deep in the weeds is crucial. You'll be shocked to discover that some things work far better than expected, while the technology fails in surprising ways as well. \n\"\nBy doing this, you'll be able to confidently implement company-wide policies and make sound strategic decisions about what AI will mean for your organization.\n\"\nGodspeed! and I look forward to seeing everyone in 2025 back in California for next year's conference. \n\"\nSpecial thanks to the volunteer team, our sponsors, and our speakers who made this year's event a resounding success.\n\"\n\"cc Shuja Keen Anvisha Pai Dima Ayyash Rebeca Eun Young Hwang Stacy Yu Mainak Ghosh Daniela Gorza, thank you for going above and beyond, leading the entire volunteer team (all of whom I'd tag here were it not for LinkedIn's tagging limits!) to an excellent outcome — now, onto the next one :)",

    "content": "AI as \"suprasocial media\" & what happens when we collectively stop typing and start talking...\"\n\"\nThere's been some interesting discussion about the accuracy and reliability of AI scribes for doctors (in particular, that there are discrepancies between the doctor or patient's recollection of the visit and what's contained in the machine-generated notes), and that, I think, begs the question of, \"Is rote note-taking even the correct application of this technology in this scenario?\" \n\"\nIt's become clear to me that AI is actually a \"discursive\" medium (vs. a broadcast one), and IMO, instead of simply translating a raw recording into EHR-compatible text, the computer should first ask the doctor tough questions post–patient encounter. \n\"\nOne could make the argument that writing itself is just a simulation of discourse (a less expensive and more accessible technology than the thing you really want, which is a competent and contextually aware thought partner) because you're externalizing your thoughts and interacting with them as they're transmitted back to you visually.\n\"\nAs Moore's Law moves us closer to resolving Moravec's Paradox (LLMs / GPUs are actually something like the neuronal structures in our \"gut,\" a step below hyper-rational CPU-enabled deductive reasoning), we should expect a shift to oral/discursive communication (and, then, maybe that's supplanted something like vibe-based embodied interaction as spatial and ambient computing technologies mature and eventually dovetail); given the global scale and speed-of-light distribution of information IT enables, the key difference between how our ancestors used those kinds of media and our experience with this new twist on something ancient will be the suprasocial nature of it all: When you interact with an AI, who/what is on the other end? \n\"\nIt's not a person, but it's not quite a tool either.\n\"\nOne of the first things I always recommend to clients when they start learning how to use AI to GSD is that they, \"stop typing and start talking.\" It's a tough habit to break, but once you do, the scope of what you can do with computers explodes, since you can more directly input your thoughts into a computer.\n\"\nBut, as we come to rely on AI-mediated experiences (again, as opposed to the 1:1 display of your unprocessed thoughts reflected to you via word processor), those outputs will be shaped by increasingly incomprehensibly complex (and evolving!) processes, like single cells receiving signals from a CNS.\n\"\n\"All this is to say that, practically, it's becoming more important than ever to unplug periodically. Technology is good; AI is good. But, don't forget to take the exocortex off periodically and \"think naked.\" Otherwise, you may find yourself conforming to the system, rather than participating in it.",

It's not just about reducing cycle times; it’s critical to maintain vibrant energy levels in teams to drive success and drive forward progress via innovation vs. latent customer needs.\n\"\nThat new surplus energy and attention can be reinvested in \"micro-R&D/BD,\" and that's where the long-term gains from unexpected asymmetric upside opportunities come from.\n\"\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this, Fernando Barroso Gallegos (and h/t for an engaging chat yesterday that spurred this post)!

    "content": "There's an increasingly common AI trope that I'd like to address. It's an idea that I think is somewhat correct in a very local sense but also acts as a distraction from a deeper point. The trope suggests that if you're not integrating AI into your business, you'll be left behind. It claims that it's not AI taking your job, but rather people using AI will take it. \"\n\"\nThere's some truth to this. Clearly, AI as a general-purpose technology will become important. Complete resistance to using it, learning about it, or experimenting isn't a great strategy. However, there is a deeper perspective shift to consider and ultimately adopt. This shift offers benefits from AI as a means but is also more enduring regardless of what happens in technology.\n\"\nTo thrive in the 21st century, I've come to believe that it is absolutely for everyone—from frontline operators to C-level executives—to strive to be ferociously and radically customer-centric. Your objective function above all else should be to will the good of the persona, and more importantly, the literal individuals that your institution exists to serve. Commit to doing so at higher levels of need, scope, and scale.\n\"\nIn line with this objective, seek to become as trustworthy as you can. This can be understood and acted upon via the lens of the trust equation, where each lever is one you can work on at a given time in the context of a relationship—whether with a customer, employee, or colleague. There's an opportunity to take steps becoming excellent at what you do, make explicit predictions that align with measurable results, cultivate unique interests, and take little personal risks without expecting reciprocation. Most importantly, prioritize the interests of the other party above your own.\n\"\nThese are my personal understandings of the equation variables: credibility, reliability, intimacy, and self-orientation. \n\"\n\"In that light, I think the most useful and true way to think about AI in your professional life is to see it as a means to be more customer-centric and trustworthy. This perspective has always been true, is true now, and will continue to good regardless of what the future holds for us as we go deeper into the 21st century.",

At least 4 deep work cycles (~8 hours total): in practice, if you're able to truly put the blinders on for 1–2 work days and only focus on going 0 to 1 with your first web application (that works!), you can absolutely get there. \n\"\nPreviously (and I'm speaking personally here), this step took weeks, much of which was spent scouring StackOverflow, which is enough friction to dissuade a lot of creative word-people like myself to not take something to production.\n\"\n2. Desire: This is generally important for any difficult work endeavor; but, when it comes to this particular task, it's critical. The good news is once you get that first burst of energy from seeing your code work and you get an outcome that would have been impossible or taken you weeks of manual work, you'll never go back. It's quite a high. \n\"\nBut, before and after that point, there will be many bits of confusion and frustration you'll need to endure—and they're a lot easier to get through if you have both a carrot and stick established at the beginning. \n\"\nI'd recommend doing the follow to kick this off right: do a 30–60-minute remote interview with a colleague about their most annoying workflow problems (e.g., drafting follow-up emails or post-call CRM entries) with an AI notetaker like Fireflies.ai in attendance. \n\"\nThen, pipe that transcript into Claude Pro and ask it to help you ideate on, spec out, and then implement in code a little app that would solve your colleague's problem.\n\"\nCommit to delivery of a URL that they can visit on their own time where they'll get access to something that will make their life easier per one of the problems latent in the transcript—set an immutable due date!\n\"\nOnce you have a due date (stick) and clear good (carrot), you'll be in good shape.\n\"\nFrom that point it's a matter of grit, a balance of furious forward movement as you make quick changes and test on your local machine and deep thought as you grok the AI's explanation of what it's doing/how it all works together (don't gloss over these parts, and ask questions if you're confused!), and unbroken attention.\n\"\nBonus: if you want to go even faster, use superwhisper to talk (in lieu of typing) to Claude (or ChatGPT) as you work with it.\n\"\n\"Good luck!",

AI will enable a new era of remote, asynchronous, fractional work by lowering barriers of space, time, language and culture. This will accelerate the emergence of global liquid labor markets.\n\"\n2. The most valuable data will come from solving real problems for people at the frontiers of fields. Digitizing both the process and results will allow this data to be leveraged as a complement to increasingly commoditized AI. \n\"\n3. AI's main value is as a compressor and filter - it allows the most important unresolved items to quickly be surfaced so humans can focus their limited attention on what matters most. The key is providing it high-quality, salient data.\n\"\n4. Voice will become the dominant interface for personal computing as AI capabilities grow. This will necessitate rethinking home and office environments to provide privacy for talking to computers.\n\"\n5. Trust is the most important factor for productivity. AI may help build trust at scale by facilitating rich asynchronous interactions and surfacing the most relevant information.\n\"\n6. Corporations will need to fundamentally re-architect themselves around AI, becoming leaner and more muscular. Standard employer-employee relationships will evolve as more tacit knowledge can be digitized.\n\"\n7. The ceiling on individual productivity is rising faster than the floor due to AI. Power users leveraging the tools in sophisticated ways will see exponential gains.\n\"\n8. Curiosity, humility and a focus on doing what energizes you are key to thriving in an AI-powered economy. The goal is reducing uncertainty on the path to ambitious goals.\n\"\n9. We're still very early in the AI transformation, comparable to the early days of electrification. The full implications will take decades to play out but will be profound.\n\"\n10. AI can enhance critical thinking by probing human reasoning with incisive questions. The aim is elevating quality of thought, not delegating thinking to machines.\n\"\n\"Special thanks to Claude for helping me compress all of my posts since '23 into just one :)",

    "content": "The real impacts of AI go beyond the tech itself - and those deserve more thought & action!\"\n\"\nIf you look at a lot of the discussions around risks, policy, etc., everyone seems to be really focused on the models and the tech per se - issues related to copyright, bias, free speech, using AI to create bioweapons, etc. \n\"\nFrankly, I think those issues, while they may deserve some attention, are largely overrated. The technology (and speculative first-order effects) are somewhat interesting. \n\"\nBut I think the social technologies, the ways in which people organize themselves and share information, and the second and potentially third order effects of widespread AI use, are significantly more interesting (and practically important).\n\"\nSome of these effects are relatively predictable, and it would behoove corporate leaders and policymakers to try to get ahead of this and think about the implications. \n\"\nHere are three key areas I want to unpack:\n\"\n1. Data Security & Sensitive Information  \n\"\nAI is significantly more useful the more high-fidelity, proprietary and fresh the data you put into it is. This is driving the proliferation of AI note-takers and will drive adoption of ambient computing platforms. \n\"\nWhere the data goes is important. Centralized AI labs are not unlikely maintain a lead over open source, becoming like \"too-big-to-fail (data) banks.\n\"\nThis data is increasingly sensitive and exploitable by third parties. Unauthorized access is a huge concern.\n\"\nWe may need to consider AI user privilege protections, similar to doctor-patient or attorney-client confidentiality.\n\"\n2. New Corporate Structures & Ways of Working\n\"\nAI enables rapid upskilling of entry-level workers, who can delegate tasks and onboard faster. \n\"\nTop experts can focus more on pushing the frontier of their craft and creating outsized value.\n\"\nThis puts immense pressure on the bulk of \"average\" skilled workers in the middle. They face competition from below and can't keep up with the top.\n\"\nOrganizations will face pressure to radically restructure workflows and roles around AI to stay competitive. Jobs will be unbundled into tasks and rebundled in ways that are hard to predict.\n\"\nManaging this transition for workers and helping them adapt is essential. Self-discovery and differentiation of individual strengths is key.\n\"\n3. Speed & Depth of Transformation \n\"\nKnowledge work based on information/bits is more malleable than physical atoms. Value chains can be re-engineered faster than in past technological revolutions, e.g., adoption of electricity into manufacturing workflows. \n\"\nThere will be immense pressure to reform organizational structures and processes to leverage AI productivity gains.\n\"\nCapital will flow to these new structures, especially in competitive industries.\n\"\nSo—what are some other topics in AI (outside of the tech) that deserve more attention?\n\"\n\"What would you add to this list?",

You can do this by setting a measurable team-wide target of \"meeting recordings shared in Slack channel x with actionable insights generated during a debrief\" to make these units of work legible; after a month or so, with some artful weekly managerial intervention + attention paid to actual v. target, this AI-enhanced loop will become a cultural habit.\n\"\nExecutives should use AI-as-telescope/miscroscope to mine left- and right-tailed exceptions from all recordings at a regular cadence and:\n\"\n1. Directly reward the creators of right-tailed customer experiences,\n\"\n2. Do RCAs on left-tailed outcomes and delegate intervention responsibilities to the appropriate level of management (could be direct, but doesn't have to be), and\n\"\n3. Incorporate those data into weekly sense-making + accountable action planning syncs (the only live team meeting you need in a truly AI-native, remote, async organization) and use them to reduce uncertainty around longer-term goals (3x in parallel at 50% certainty targets at the beginning of a trimester [and high WoW volatility] is good for \"order out of chaos\" initiatives; you can follow a similar pattern to \"fight entropy\"/boost reliability with 1 target over the same period, but starting at an 85% conf. level).\n\"\nThe key is creating the right AI-powered virtuous cycle at the point of contact between the org and the external world, where value is created/exchanged, and then, as a function of having to make those interactions legible to AI for it to be valuable, cultivating a data asset that can be queried directly by as many other people at the company as possible; the bottoms-up legibility is complemented by top-down legibility (executive meetings where the most complex problems are surfaced are also published to Slack), enabling both democratic participation in the pursuit of the unifying objective, while enabling the entire organization to take aligned action via centralized intention-setting.\n\"\nThe real twist? \n\"\n\"Given this setup, the same person can step into frontline and executive roles in the same day...",

Visceral contact with customers themselves, deeply engaged in problem solving and running experiments until there was the magical \"click\" of product–market fit.\n\"\nIn a pre-IT world, unmediated contact by the c-suite with the \"front lines,\" especially when the scope of the organization is enormous, was notoriously difficult, and there was always a meaningful loss of signal as information travels (relatively slowly) up the chain of managers; additionally, process knowledge, which, in reality, is and should be continuously developed and cultivated, tended to get frozen in SOPs and other lossy one-size-fits-all media.\n\"\nIn a post-AI world (which is really just the next phase of the IT revolution), customer interactions can be captured, aggregated, and mined in near-real-time (via AI notetakers like Fireflies.ai and Claude-powered data processing pipelines) and made available not only via your traditional dashboards and PDB-style updates, but also new discursive media (interactive chat interfaces, which will soon be further enhanced with low-latency audio-to-audio model capabilities).\n\"\nThe fact that these LLMs (and next-generation multimodal models) are such good compressors, means that the best aspects of \"founder mode\" (regular, unmediated contact between the c-suite and the front — and then substantially raised expectations for operators, with ambitious quantitative targets derived from the insights gained from an object-level analysis of the raw data) can be realized by any organization, not just your flashy Silicon Valley startup—if the leaders so choose.\n\"\nWant to go fast, blast through bureaucracy, and continuously find new ways to 10x the value you deliver to customers?\n\"\n\"Founder mode\" (catalyzed by a healthy dose of generative AI technology and perennial management technē in the form of a \"one objective to rule them all\" OKR cycle) might be right for you.",

I am deeply skeptical that this is feasible, but would love to learn from some other exotic management approach that is 100% remote AND async.",

Retrieving the requisite information can be challenging if, for example, you don't have a dedicated chief of staff.</p>\n\n<p>The good news?</p>\n\n<p>AI tools can help you create high-quality, engaging investor updates (and really any form of high-stakes communication —&nbsp;proposals, internal corporate updates, etc.) faster than ever.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a step-by-step guide:</p><hr><p><strong>1. Capture high-quality input&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The key to great AI-generated content is providing high-quality input (NOT relying on the AI to think/write for you—which is what leads to generic \"AI slop\" content).</p>\n\n<p>Schedule discussions with key stakeholders (co-founders, leadership team, etc.) to surface all the important information and record the meetings using tools like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/otter-ai/\">Otter.ai</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/fireflies-inc/\">Fireflies.ai</a>. The goal is to get as much relevant information out of their heads and into a format the AI can use; ask good questions!</p><hr><p><strong>2. Feed the transcripts into Claude 3 Opus</strong></p>\n\n<p>Next, copy and paste the discussion transcripts into Claude dot ai; it's the best general purpose tool for writing, hands-down.</p>\n\n<p>Verbally articulate clear instructions on what you want to create via verbal direction, enabled by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/superwhisper/\">superwhisper</a>; include a persona instantiation (\"your are an expert [x] with an IQ of 120\"), instructions that make explicit your own tacit knowledge and editorial commentary NOT present in the transcripts, formatting specifications, and examples of gold standard investor emails for reference.</p><figure><img data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQED2EgNxsTg7Q\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQED2EgNxsTg7Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1722858065854?e=1744848000&v=beta&t=LpxFPJisSnUUrmDuBULpcx3t1BUfq_QCXaqxPUKCNYs\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Claude will analyze the transcripts and generate an initial email draft.</p><hr><p><strong>3. Identify gaps and gather additional information&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Have Claude identify any core information gaps in the initial draft (e.g., quantitative metrics, details in re a particular partnership) and generate specific questions you can take back to your team.</p>\n\n<p>Record another discussion to fill in those gaps (or, if you want to take things to the next level, set up a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/vapi-ai/\">Vapi</a> assistant with a comprehensive prompt that includes the questions and directions to ask probing follow-up questions, put it behind a phone number, and send an email to the expert[s] with the information you need, asking them to call it for a few minutes at their convenience); take this new crop of transcripts and feed the additional information back into the same Claude.</p>\n\n<p>Repeat until you're satisfied.</p><hr><p><strong>4. Pressure test the email with simulated recipients</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use Claude to simulate an investor's perspective and score the draft email (literally, \"step into the investor recipient's shoes —&nbsp;how likely, from 0–100% would you be to respond with a clear offer to help? Let's think it through step-by-step to get to the right answer.\").</p>\n\n<p>Then, ask, \"What would have to be true for the likelihood to be 10% higher?\"</p>\n\n<p>Claude will enumerate specific gaps; using the raw information capture methods in (3), iteratively improve the email until it receives a high rating. This ensures your message will resonate with real investors before you hit send</p>\n\n<p>(This is the core general lesson of this whole exercise, by the way —&nbsp;the real value of AI is in boosting <em>quality</em>, FASTER, not producing large quantities of mediocre output.)</p><hr><p><strong>5. Customize for specific investors</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you'd like, tailor the polished email draft for specific key investors. Provide Claude with context about each investor's background and interests, and have it customize their version of the email boilerplate accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Personalization boosts engagement, and you might be able to get significantly more precise with your investor asks.</p>\n\n<p>Then, hit send!</p><hr><p>Remember, the key is providing high-quality input, iterating with the AI to refine the output, pressure testing the results, and customizing for the audience. Mastering this workflow will make you a more effective communicator and free up time to focus on moving the business forward.</p><blockquote><p>Have you used AI to improve your investor or customer communications?

    "content": "One of my favorite AI tools is Loom.\"\n\"\nNow, I love Loom because it's not a pure AI tool, let's say like Claude or ChatGPT, but it quickly becomes an essential part of the toolkit if you're going operate your business in an AI-native way. \n\"\nThis means, when it comes to team norms and managerial capacity, you need to be able to work with other folks remotely (and then probably asynchronously and even in a fractional capacity). \n\"\nThis involves partnering with talented people for one-off deliverables or more expert indie consultants on high-stakes big upside outcomes for clients or customers. Traditionally, this would be prohibitively expensive because of search, onboarding, and switching costs.\n\"\nTBH, I used to actually really dislike Loom (which basically records your screen and allows you to provide a voiceover and bundles it into a video message URL you can send) because it puts a huge burden on the recipient to watch a long-form video, which consumes a lot of time and attention just to get the core content. \n\"\nBut, thanks to AI, it's now really easy to take the transcript of Loom video, pop it into a tool like Claude, and then quickly get what you need. \n\"\nThis is a highly recommended habit for high-performing AI native teams. \n\"\nThe Loom + Claude combo allows you to capture, communicate, and consume information significantly more efficiently while also giving people the freedom to do work when and how they want.\n\"\nThis also has the nice benefit of passively cultivating a data asset that you can use to grow your business and make training new employees or onboarding contractors ten times as fast. \n\"\nTacit knowledge that would otherwise get lost is now on-the-record and retrievable!\n\"\nLoom has this great new feature where you can one-click create an SOP based on the video, which is something I've been recommending to clients. \n\"\nIt is a different way of working though and necessitates the cultivation of new habits. \n\"\nThe very first step I would recommend to get going in the right direction is to choose a particular task where you have to do something repetitive, time box it to let's say 50 minutes, and then before you dive in hit the record button on Loom. \n\"\nAt that point I found it's actually easier to focus because you have this feeling that somebody's watching you and if things go right they will watch you in the future because this video will enter your internal knowledge base or be communicated elsewhere. \n\"\nAnd then, too, if you accomplish the task and even get a few reps in by the end, you can turn that into a nugget of valuable know-how immediately available to be posted in your company knowledge base (or, short of something highly structured, just a open Slack channel that anybody can search when they come on board). \n\"\n\"Do you use Loom at work?

Some companies also conduct internal Pulse surveys to capture employee perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>However, these approaches often fall short in terms of the richness, freshness, and speed of the insights generated. Important knowledge remains <em>locked in people's heads</em>, data quickly becomes stale, and it can take weeks of analysis to unearth key takeaways.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, strategic decisions are made based on an incomplete or outdated picture.</p><hr><p><strong>AI-Powered Data Collection</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is where AI can be a game-changer.</p>\n\n<p>Using tools like AI-enhanced surveys (see: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/voiceform/\" target=\"_blank\">Voiceform</a>), and automated phone interviews (e.g., via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/vapi-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Vapi</a>), companies can now collect significantly richer data from employees, especially customer-facing staff who have valuable frontline insights not captured in systems.</p>\n\n<p>For example, after receiving an email invitation to give an AI-powered phone line a call (at his or her convenience), a sales rep could verbally share observations from recent client meetings (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_before-you-an-ambitious-ceo-commit-to-a-activity-7188162805064179714-Mm6a?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">among other things</a>), which get automatically transcribed and aggregated with other fresh conversation transcripts.</p>\n\n<p>If you're a software company, to complement the frontline employee–mediated insights, you might also dig into recent product usage logs, e.g., events in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/mixpanel-inc-/\" target=\"_blank\">Mixpanel</a>, to intelligently identify power users and their key behaviors—this can stimulate additional lines of questioning or an insightful conversation with one such power user.</p><hr><p><strong>Rapid Insight Synthesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>The second way AI enhances strategic planning is by compressing the time needed to extract insights from raw data.</p>\n\n<p>With techniques like unsupervised learning, topic modeling, and summarization, AI engines can rapidly identify patterns and distill key takeaways from large, unstructured datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Short of a sophisticated prompt-chained AI pipeline, you can simply stuff the data (especially Voiceform and/or VAPI transcripts) into a new chat with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropicresearch/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a>'s Claude 3 Opus and ask it to give you the:</p><ul><li><p>General shape of things (a summary) and</p></li><li><p>Interesting anomalies that deserve the attention of the group during the goal-setting process.</p></li></ul><p>Instead of an analyst spending days manually tagging, coding, and graphing survey responses, you get a concise executive summary <em>within minutes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, business planning participants can then use natural language to interactively explore the data (i.e., asking follow-up questions via a chat interface), drilling down into items of interest.</p>\n\n<p>This allows decision-makers to incorporate much fresher, more comprehensive insights into strategic plans.</p><blockquote><p>Better ground truth data -> higher-fidelity \"maps of the territory\" -> better org-wide goals.</p></blockquote><hr><p><strong>Piloting the Approach</strong></p>\n\n<p>For companies interested in piloting an AI-enhanced strategic planning process, a reasonable timeline would be:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Week 1</strong>: Assess current planning practices, map key decisions, and identify insight gaps, then design and implement AI-powered data collection mechanisms (surveys, interviews, etc).</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Week 2</strong>: Conduct data collection in the lead up to quarterly/annual planning and use AI to synthesize insights, delivered to execs via a traditional executive summary + chatbot on top of the core data for them to query whenever they want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 3</strong>: Hold enhanced strategy sessions (also recorded, so you can compare key assumptions and hypotheses into the next cycle's preparation by comparing them to what actually happened).</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 4</strong>+: Measure improvements in strategic plan quality, alignment and execution, e.g., via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASXjCW3Ut2o\" target=\"_blank\">a rigorous OKR process</a>.</p></li></ul><hr><p>As with any new business process, it's important to start small, move quickly, and iterate based on feedback. But, the potential upside is significant—richer insights driving clearer priorities and better decisions.</p>\n\n<p>That's an edge that every executive should be eager to harness.</p>\n\n<p>The rise of AI is creating compelling new opportunities to reimagine core business activities. Strategic planning is ripe for disruption. </p>\n\n<p>Forward-leaning companies would be wise to explore how AI can help them chart a clearer course in an increasingly dynamic and competitive landscape.</p><hr><p>If you enjoyed this post, you may also enjoy <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-transforming-strategy-you-ready-christian-ulstrup-zpawe/?trackingId=1eYw%2FGEsQcuJXRLQ%2Bnn7ew%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">the recent conversation I had</a> with strategy & OKR expert <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/montgomerydan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAIn-YBNrCiLZjtuSpVDCC2RndguMGebfI\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Montgomery</a> on the topic.</p>\n\n<p>And, if it stoked your curiosity, add a question in the comments below (or <a href=\"https://calendly.com/gsdatwork/30min\" target=\"_blank\">find time for us to chat</a>)!</p> ",

Power Users: Leverage AI tools in bespoke combinations to unlock huge productivity gains\n\"\n2. Technologically Conservative Users: ~30-50% of people. Uninterested in interacting with AI directly but will pay a premium for seamless AI-powered products \n\"\n3. The \"Messy Middle\" Users: A common focus for entrepreneurs but likely overrated. Products should aim to either empower power users or make AI invisible for conservative users.\n\"\n\"\nBuilding Differentiated, Liquid Teams\n\"\n- As AI enables leaner teams, complementary skill sets and diversity of thought become critical\n\"\n- Quantifying team differentiation is a nascent but major market opportunity \n\"\n- Shared goals outweigh common ground - an ideal AI-era team could span ages, geographies and work styles united by purpose\n\"\n\"\nExpanded Search = Faster Innovation\n\"\n- AI cost-effectively broadens the \"scope of search\" for breakthroughs by connecting needs and capabilities across industries\n\"\n- Traversing large information spaces while staying nimble is key to realizing outsized opportunities \n\"\n\"\nA Boon for Relationship-Focused Roles\n\"\n- High-touch roles (sales, bizdev etc) have immense value to gain from delegating rote tasks to AI\n\"\n- Reclaiming time and energy to engage with people while closing feedback loops faster \n\"\n- These technologically conservative folks are an ideal customer for AI productivity tools\n\"\n\"\nKey Technology Shifts on the Horizon\n\"\n- Voice as a primary interface, especially as models become multimodal \n\"\n- Horizontal scaling of smaller, specialized models\n\"\n- Streamlined conversion of unstructured data to structured formats \n\"\n\"\nEmbrace Uncertainty, Create Compelling Facts\n\"\n- Heavily discount long-term AI predictions and focus on near-term experiments while your competitors speculate and pontificate about things they couldn't know\n\"\n- Aim to generate \"compelling facts\" - real examples of AI delivering value \n\"\n- The tech often works and fails in surprising ways; this info is more useful and valuable than speculative visions\n\"\n\"\nCould Voice UI Boost Cognition?\n\"\n- Speculative but fascinating idea that verbal articulation may improve quality of thought (see: Julian Jaynes's Bicameral Mind)\n\"\n- As voice interactions with AI grow, there may be interesting societal implications & knock-on effects\n\"\n\"\nIf any of these takeaways resonate with you or spark ideas, I'd love to hear your thoughts! \n\"\n\"Let's continue the conversation in the comments...",

It would seem to me that at least as a complement to existing management approaches, the C-suite's strategic intent could be literally encoded into the system prompt of the enterprise generative AI tools that all employees are using so that it's always being taken into account in the context of what they're doing, in whatever small way.\n\"\n(One could imagine, too, additional context injected into the same system prompt depending upon the person's role within the organization, their department's objectives, etc. )\n\"\nI could also imagine that this isn't (yet) feasible—if, say, the prompt were too strict, and employees were overly constrained. \n\"\nBut it does seem to me like this could be a reasonable and valuable tool in the enterprise leadership toolkit that would work alongside, for example, a rigorous & unified OKR process and ultimately achieve both greater alignment while giving employees greater degrees of freedom (w/ say unlimited access to SOTA AI, integrated deeply into the org's proprietary data assets + operational workflows): the \"why\" is always there, but individuals get way more flexibility in re the what and the how.\n\"\n\"Anyone seen anything like this in the wild?",

    "content": "I think there's a lot of alpha be found in employing certain heuristics or frameworks, especially in corporate settings, that are either generally underrated or eschewing the ones that are overrated in favor of some orthogonal new approach. \"\n\"\nOften times, I think these sort of opportunities emerge because as certain arts become more mature, a precise technical jargon gets codified to support the transfer of what had been developed initially as a tacit body of knowledge. \n\"\nAnd ultimately, what can happen is that newcomers to the field end up mistaking in some sense the material or formal cause of the art for its final cause. \n\"\nOr in other situations, there may be some confusion about final cause, in which case the heuristic or approach may actually be underrated; people are likely to discount it because they don't realize that what's actually useful for is not necessarily what people assume it be used for.\n\"\nSo all this is very abstract, but I'll give you two examples.\n\"\nOne where think the heuristic is wildly underrated are personality assessments like DISC or StrengthsFinder. I often hear people denigrate these as being corporate horoscopes or roll their eyes and mention \"HR made me do this once\" or something to that.\n\"\nBut what I find interesting about this is that that low rating or importance that they assign to that particular heuristic is actually signaled by the term horoscope which implies some degree of prediction in an overly complex system where the formal causal model is unlikely to be rooted sufficiently in reality. \n\"\nNow I would argue that that's not the point of these diagnostics. It's actually to start a conversation where individuals (working especially on a cross-functional team) can come to terms with one another and generate testable hypotheses that they can then put into practice regarding how to communicate effectively, what type of work should be delegated to whom under what circumstances, the potential conditions under which certain members of the team would get energized, etc.\n\"\nPsych research demonstrates that even fundamental personality traits can change over the course of one or more decades. So clearly, these aren't set in stone to the extent that they can be relied upon for highly precise predictions, but they can be and SF I think in particular, made useful for reducing complexity when it comes to interpersonal team dynamics to the point that testable hypotheses can be generated and acted upon. \n\"\nThis ultimately leads, when used correctly, to higher performing cross-functional teams—but only through subsequent process, not the diagnostic per se!\n\"\nOn the other hand, there are all kinds of complicated and esoteric terms of art in management, whether that's management of projects, products or corporations as a whole...\n\"\n\"(Cont'd in comments...)",

Compressing huge volumes of (proprietary) info into something you can wrap your arms around and ultimately make a decision/take an action based off of; think: piping a ton of call / meeting transcripts into Claude 3 Opus and then sending effective follow-up emails, setting new strategic direction, teasing out insights and exploiting them, etc.; and\n\"\n2. Creating and deploying software based on said proprietary information/know-how with help from, e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\"\nThere are others (and many variations of each), but those are the two most powerful.\n\"\nIt used to be prohibitively expensive for a single person (or small, diverse team) to accomplish 1 & 2 without hiring lots of very expensive and semi-specialized labor, which introduces organizational complexity and can slow things down.\n\"\nThe models are continuing to get better, which means the relative cost of 1 & 2 will continue to drop.\n\"\nIMO, if you want to really take advantage of AI/these new word-crunching capabilities, there are some basic tools in the toolkit I'd recommend:\n\"\n1. Claude Pro\n2. Otter AI or Fireflies for recording meetings\n3. superwhisper for rapidly iterating via verbal speech vs. typing (higher-bandwidth + faster iterations w/ foundation models will get you to where you want to go incredibly quickly)\n4. Loom for async communication\n5. Stripe for billing\n6. Figma Jamboards for digital whiteboarding\n7. Descript for multimedia editing/manipulation\n8. An AWS account\n9. An Upwork client account (for delegating tasks that necessitate a bit more reliability than the models can handle atm — e.g., internet research, although I anticipate companies like MultiOn will incrementally crack the code over the next year or two).\n10. Agency Cybersecurity for premium sec coverage — the complement to AI is data, so the more data you collect the more seriously you need to take security seriously\n\"\nThere are some more advanced/particular ones, especially metered web services, that you'll want to add to your repertoire (Mixpanel is one), but you don't need to worry about those until you start building more software.\n\"\nIf you are highly motivated to solve a particular problem for someone (and make it easy for them to solve said problem over and over via a bit of custom code), enough that you can make it through the 20+ clicks it takes to get a particular result (there's lots of piping data between these applications by hand to get what you want, and, unfortunately, I don't really see that changing for a while), then you are already in the new paradigm.\n\"\nA lot of what people are excited about in re AI is already possible today, again, if you have the fortitude to make it through all of these little clicks and copy/pasting screenshots, text, etc. from one application to another. \n\"\n\"All you need to do is believe that it's possible (it is!) and get a ton of reps in cycling between 1 & 2, hiring AI to help do bits and pieces until you strike gold!",

I'm headed to the Professional Services Council Acquisition conference today.\n\"\nNormally, I do some pretty rigorous research on speakers, other attendees, etc. But I'm a bit time pressed at the moment. So instead, on my morning walk, I opened up the conference app, scrolled through the attendee list, and some of the programming, and put on ChatGPT voice in the background. \n\"\nAs I had questions about what I was seeing, I would simply ask ChatGPT voice, whether it was to tell me about a company, maybe some recent news, a particular attendee, or a speaker, and any interesting positions that they've taken on a topic — and it did a pretty good job with (from what I can tell are increasingly capable) web search to load salient data into the context window!\n\"\nNow, the information, of course, isn't as rich as if I had opened a bunch of different browser windows on my desktop machine and did my usual piping of YouTube transcripts, podcast episodes, etc. into tools like Claude, ChatGPT, etc. Or use MultiOn to quickly peruse LinkedIn profiles, all in parallel. \n\"\nBut it got the job done, and well enough that I feel like I have sufficient context to spark conversations with some folks I'd love to connect with at the event. \n\"\nWhat enables this is a new ChatGPT feature that allows you to actually turn on voice in the background. So you don't have to be on the app, and you can browse around to different other applications. \n\"\nSoon, allegedly, you'll be able to share your screen as well, so it'll have the context of what you're looking at and can incorporate that into its responses. This is definitely a paradigm shift in terms of human-computer interaction. \n\"\n\"And if you want a taste of what's coming, I'd recommend experimenting with this particular pattern on your next walk break.",

    "content": "Every week, I practice what I preach and try to accelerate my consultancy's progress towards my highest-order goals with an AI-assisted OKR sync. \"\n\"\nHere are a few things I learned this week:\n\"\n• Digital tools for not just remote but asynchronous communication and collaboration are getting better and better. I really believe if you're able to put constraints in place that force you to learn how to use them to solve problems for other people, it ends up being a major advantage because you're afforded many more degrees of freedom. \n\"\n• For example, instead of automatically scheduling a call, I try to do as much discovery as I can upfront using AI tools to do deep research on a client or prospect, codify my analysis in a Figma  whiteboard, and then send a rich and comprehensive Loom  video with a call to action to take the next step. This could be scheduling a live call, talking to a voice agent who can ask the person specific questions, or even paying via a Stripe custom product link for a particular output or outcome that I propose. This has allowed me to align the hardest problems with the times of the day when my energy levels are highest.\n\"\n• I'm continually surprised and fascinated by this liminal space between people and computers when it comes to delegation. As AI becomes more capable, hiring computers for a particular task rather than a person becomes a lot more sensible (eg MultiOn for information retrieval vs. or prior to hiring a freelance researcher.) However, there are cases where pure human labor is more reliable. This necessitates discernment when it comes to the what/when/how of \"who\" to delegate to, whether it's speed, quality, reliability, the amount of information that you're at liberty to share, etc.\n\"\nI'll continue to report back on what I learned but the bottom line is AI-powered humans that are distributed in space and time are a whole new category of workforce that I expect to emerge in interesting ways in the years ahead.\n\"\nFeel free to add questions in the comments.\n\"\n\"(I'll probably start publishing these updates on a more regular basis as I figure out what exactly it takes to ride the AI wave and build a business in a new way that the technology fundamentally enables.)",

    "content": "AI is starting to fundamentally change my relationship with time. \"\n\"\nSimilar to how computers, as they go from number crunching word crunching machines, are transforming the \"how\" and \"what\" of knowledge work via an expanding scope of delegatable tasks, these new capabilities also allow us to approach the \"when\" of work in a qualitatively different way by making it possible to \"pull\" future outcomes into the present. \n\"\nInstead of waiting for something to happen (e.g., that meeting next week), one might instead prioritize what to focus on in the context of ambitious, uncertain, longer-term goals. With AI assistance, it's possible to reduce uncertainty toward a final cause by crunching previously impossible volumes of information during high-energy, deep work sessions (which can also have the effect of bringing a bit more clarity to formal causes). \n\"\nOnce you've hit the limit of a time-boxed task, you can asynchronously tap into a liquid labor force, either through expert consults via voice agents or horizontally scalable task orders (eg for research and information retrieval) via platforms like Upwork by transforming the raw recordings you have on hand of salient contextual data and the recorded process (say, a Loom video) of you doing reps 1-10, providing enough specificity to guide successful task completion while also protecting sensitive info but running it all through a SOTA model like Claude first.\n\"\nThis dovetails nicely with cultivating a habit of communicating via rich media (vs. email or text only). This approach, previously time-consuming for the recipient of a long-form, unpolished video can now be summarized with a personalized set of headlines beforehand or interacted with directly via the other party's AI intermediary. \n\"\nConstant experimentation with AI over the past year (towards the end of helping a diverse array of clients across industries accelerate toward their BHAGs) has taught me to continuously question whether I might be able to delegate that next task that needs to get done (and I more or less know how to do), but don't find particularly energizing to sufficiently (and increasingly) competent machines.\n\"\nAs we continue to reorient the way we work with these new tools in hand, I anticipate we might be able to enter more fruitful relationship with time (and globally distributed collaborators) as well. \n\"\nInstead of being constrained by our calendars, waiting anxiously for our next back-to-back Zoom call, we can instead reduce pockets of uncertainty by tackling a queue of highly engaging, challenging, valuable chunks of work—and bring desired outcomes into our locus of control.\n\"\n\"(Screenshot from my OKR sync \"with\" Claude this morning — I record a monologue that follows the same process I run with clients and engage in a little AI-powered thought partnership post to help me make sense of what I've learned over the past week.)",

Now they can crunch words, and they're getting better at it. \n\"\nSoon, they'll be able to handle raw audio, video, and other more exotic data.\n\"\nJust like you use Excel to perform functions on numbers, you can use large language models (LLMs) to process words. \n\"\nAnd, as the scope of what can be computed expands (numbers, words, etc.), so does the scope of what you can delegate to machines.\n\"\n⏩ The primary benefit you are afforded is neither cost nor quality but \"speed.\n\"\nOnce a computer can produce an output at a satisfying level of quality, you can delegate the creation of that output to an AI system. \n\"\nAlthough what the computer produces may ultimately be only on par with what you or somebody you would have hired would have produced, it's likely that the machine will do so 10–1,000 times faster.\n\"\n✅ This means that certain tasks and subtasks (that previously took days or weeks) can now be completed in just minutes via prudent delegation to these word-crunching machines.\n\"\n🔄 While not everything can be delegated, the aggregate impact of this process refactoring is a reduced overall cycle time.\n\"\n🎯 Thus, you can redirect surplus time and attention to taking action under conditions of uncertainty by pulling new desirable outcomes closer to the present. And at best, you are applying the same approach to helping your customers solve their goals.\n\"\nThis increased speed and flexibility opens up a solution space where you can not only experiment with technology but also new business models. \n\"\nInstead of being anchored to selling inputs (billable hours) or outputs (one-size-fits-all deliverables), you can now focus on selling against uncertain outcomes and charge accordingly.\n\"\nP.S:\n\"\n\"If you could wave a magic wand and do one thing a thousand times faster, what would it be?",

    "date": "2024-06-08",
    "content": "You often hear the term \"responsible AI\" these days. It's often used in reference to issues like hallucination, bias, or killer robots. While they deserve attention, there are two things you should really consider now, if you want to use AI responsibly: privacy & security and expecting all employees to start acting like managers.\"\n\"\nRegarding privacy, here's an uncomfortable truth about the generative AI boom: as the models get more powerful, there's increasing incentive to record everything. I refer to this as \"digital manifest destiny.\" Unlike Google, where you type in short queries, to get quality outputs from large language models and their successors, you need to feed in high fidelity, raw recordings. These are currently captured through AI note takers and soon other means as \"ambient compute\" becomes more common.\n\"\nThe norms are changing. You might now expect your remote conversations to be recorded through tools like Otter or Fireflies. But the responsibility of securing and managing this repository of digital memories is huge. Not only are you protecting your own secrets, but also those of others. The seriousness of this responsibility is seen in the severe penalties imposed on psychologists, priests, and lawyers if they reveal clients' secrets. \n\"\nTo address this, consider upgrading your security. This means developing guidelines, policies, and a prudent approach to information access and compartmentalization. These can be bolstered by multi-factor authentication, biometric passkeys, coverage by Agency (they offer Crowdstrike to SMBs), and a meaty cybersecurity insurance policy.\n\"\nThe second issue is that as you use AI, you take on the responsibilities of a manager — even if you're traditionally an individual contributor. By delegating tasks to an AI system and signing off on them, you're putting your reputation on the line, just like a manager would. As AI gets more powerful and more tasks can be delegated, the scope of your responsibilities and consequences of your decisions will likely grow. Therefore, it's essential to have quality assurance, quality control, and risk mitigation practices in place. \n\"\nThis will be a difficult transition for many AI users.

    "content": "Interesting study. \"\n\"\nI have three comments, based on my professional experience integrating Generative AI into production workflows from the level of the sole proprietorship all the way up to the enterprise over the past year+:\n\"\nFirst, even within the same function, I've observed consistently a power law distribution in terms of technology usage and value created. As a rule of thumb, one person amongst a peer group of 10 colleagues with similar responsibilities will account for 90% of the usage and also a similar percentage of value created. Most of that value is in cycle time reduction, which allows them to invest surplus time and attention into higher order activities that you couldn't have necessarily anticipated. While yes, you can make those user-led innovation–driven workflows powered by AI more accessible to their peers with streamlined user experiences and some custom software development, from what I can tell, the power law curve still applies, and I'd even go so far to speculate that in general the ceiling is rising faster than the floor. (The glib version of this comment would be, \"skill issue,\" although it's probably more accurate to describe the limiting factors as \"mindset\" and \"desire\" more specifically.)\n\"\nApplying this in aggregate, it's entirely possible that we might, at least in certain sectors, only see a marginal bump in GDP. However, at the levels of specific individuals and businesses, the differences could be quite extreme. \n\"\nSecond, information technology and the internet in general dovetail with generative AI and so lower barriers to global labor market participation in ways beyond just space - including time, culture, language, and many other dynamics one might consider. This is likely to put downward pressure on white-collar wages in developed countries for existing, known tasks, especially since young, very online, AI powered autodidacts in, say, Subharan Africa, are more flexible on important things like \"business model,\" e.g., outcome-based compensation and fractional employment as the norm vs. the FTE expectation in the US. \n\"\nThird, the new jobs, unmet needs, problems, and capital configurations that will likely emerge as the technology becomes more capable and integrated into the broader global economy are not just unknown, but probably unknowable and even unimaginable. \n\"\nAs individuals reclaim surplus time, attention, and energy, they'll discover new, compelling, and unexpected ways to utilize it, unlocking new economic opportunities, generating insights about our world, and broadening our access to both information space and reality itself. \n\"\n\"Although I am a fan of AI mythbusting (there is much hype that needs to be dispelled), I'm largely optimistic that everyone will have the opportunity to experience significant benefits. However, it's important to acknowledge that it's impossible to know, or even really speculate, how exactly this might unfold until the experiment has been conducted.",

    "content": "When it comes to \"prompt engineering,\" there are only three things that matter:\"\n\"\n1. Model capabilities: If you're not restricted due to latency or data handling policy requirements, you will almost always want to use the most powerful foundation model. Cost is generally not an issue here, except for edge cases where you need to massively scale up a particular process horizontally. But those are relatively rare in production settings, especially since the state of the art keeps marching forward. And foundation model costs are at least competitive with the human alternatives. \n\"\n2. Intent: Having a very clear idea of your desired (uncertain) outcome that is a result of applying the output that you're generating with the prompt provides important context that, in my experience, has a substantial effect on output quality. While this may be latent in proprietary high-fidelity data that you load into the context window, it also may only ultimately be in your head. So you need to articulate it specifically to the system to really get what you want. \n\"\n3. Proprietary, salient, high-fidelity, and high-quality context data: This usually comes in the form of meeting transcripts, especially one that literally just happened where you discussed at length the nature of the problem that you're trying to solve, ideally, with all parties who have a stake in its resolution. You can retrieve other context either from your private repository or digital exhaust that exists publicly, but in terms of determining the output, those are secondary. \n\"\n\"On the most recent episode of Machine Learning Street Talk, the guests shared an insight that LLMs are complex dynamical systems which aligns with my own experience and which, highly constrained, and in my opinion, over-engineered prompts are significantly less valuable than the more flexible, bespoke ones that leverage the components enumerated above.

    "content": "Something I've noticed that's really interesting about moving to this asynchronous by default working style is that not only are you able to pull outcomes or actions into the present instead of having to wait to have a meeting or schedule it sometime in the future, so your cycle times are basically reduced, but you're also able to find a nice fit between your own natural energy levels and your queue of tasks.\"\n\"\nThere are heuristics that you can use to block time, let's say in the morning, to do deep work and estimate when you might be in the best mindset to do something, but even that's not a hundred percent predictive. So, instead being able to crush the things that need to get done once you've decoupled them from live meetings, when you have the energy, and then attend to those other items later when you're tapped out, has this interesting effect where you're constantly pulling things into the present.\n\"\nAnd it also makes work significantly more enjoyable so you both get the upside of moving things forward without having to do a live meeting which, for example, you can do with voice agents to collect information asynchronously, but also it avoids the downside of somebody being wiped out or low energy or whatever the case might be when you finally get to that scheduled meeting.\n\"\n\"Lots more to think about here, but this is a pretty revolutionary way of working and it's boosted my own productivity substantially.",

    "content": "I cannot stress how big of a deal bespoke voice assistants are going to be.\"\n\"\nHere's how I'm already using them (via Vapi (YC W21) :\n\"\n1. I run a quarterly strategy and management process for clients with a two hour reflection at the end. Normally, I send some minimal reflection material to participants and then go in cold. But a couple weeks ago, I included a phone number that was connected to a VAPI voice agent that was loaded up with a bunch of questions that were super specific and pertinent to some of the things that we had seen over the last three months. \n\"\nOne of the participants called the number, talked to it for 20 minutes, and that had two interesting benefits. One was I got a bunch of really high quality information that I could easily incorporate into the reflection the next day. And then two, it seemed to be helpful in preparing her by helping her think through some of the stuff that was on her mind that she wanted to bring up during the session. \n\"\n2. In regards to contractor vetting, because I work with folks internationally (and I'm happy to respect their privacy to some extent but also need to maintain a high degree of security), I have policies and systems that allow me to sufficiently compartmentalize information while tapping into global talent and delegating well scoped tasks or even larger projects. In lieu of a traditional background check then, I have a voice agent that the contractor can call into, which has a few different questions that I asked to gauge their trustworthiness, including some behavioral questions. And then I tailor it to each person. Because it's live, it's more difficult for somebody to lie or bluff their way through it, since I have a slight information advantage and I can interpret emotional cues in their voice when listening to the recording. \n\"\n3. And then for the micro consults: I've been looking for expertise and inputs when it comes to AI sales enablement tools. I offered a few experts a pro rated (per minute) payment at half their hourly rate to talk to this voice assistant that I've loaded up with some really specific questions and also gave it the leeway to be curious and ask probing or follow up questions, which works really well when it's powered in particular by Anthropic Claude 3 Opus. There's also an outcome-based payment, where I'll double compensation if I end up closing a prospect this week, with my pitch at least informed by that expertise I tapped into via the asynchronous interview.\n\"\nIn summary, a huge design space has opened up, and I can't stress how much of an opportunity there is to rethink your processes with this new capability.\n\"\n\"Got some other ideas?

    "content": "Before you, an ambitious CEO, commit to a quarterly strategic direction, it's critical that you've gathered sufficient high-quality information to inform the goal-setting process.\"\n\"\nI've found 5 questions to be particularly potent, so I make sure they're answered by all stakeholders (the executive team at least, and ideally the entire company, either during live interviews or asynchronously via a service like Voiceform or Vapi (YC W21)) prior to our all-day objective-setting workshop.\n\"\nThey are:\n\"\n1. \"The Bayesian\": How confident are you, from 1–99%, that [your company] will [accomplish its specified mission] by [1, 5, or 10 years]? What would have to be true for your answer to be [20% higher]? And why wasn't it [20% lower]?\n\"\n2. \"The pre-mortem\": If [your company] fails to [achieve its mission], why would that have been the case?\n\"\n3. \"The Peter Thiel question\": What is one thing you know to be true about [your company/the industry] that few other people at [your company] would agree with you on?\n\"\n4. \"The battery question\": Over the past three months, can you think of a single time you felt most energized? And then a time you felt most drained?\n\"\n5. \"The surplus quantifier\": If I were to wave a magic wand and take all of the [energy-draining tasks] off your plate, and you could reinvest all that surplus time and attention into [energy-giving tasks], how would that feel? And, assuming I could snap my fingers and make this 100% a reality, today, what would be an offensive amount of money for me to ask for?\n\"\nAll, and especially the first three, inform strategy and direction-setting. The last two can also help you understand where you're likely to get the biggest boost from generative AI, since energy-draining tasks that need to get done, your team knows how to do, but no one really wants to do can be prudently delegated to word-crunching machines.\n\"\nBring it all together to, during that critical all-day workshop, focus on the frontier & contemplate — and then during the quarter: delegate, orchestrate, and accelerate.\n\"\n\"What other questions would you add to the 5 above?",

    "content": "I've noticed a lot of concern amongst managers and parents that AI is going to serve as a substitute for critical thinking. But I'd argue that not only does this not have to be the case, it actually can't be the case in the long run.\"\n\"\nSince any knowledge or information that's not new will be commoditized at rates we've never seen before, simply because of how the technology works. So if you want to get into a habit of using AI to elevate your own critical thinking skills and help you perform, or your employees perform at the top of their license, so to speak, then get into a habit of:\n\"\n1. Providing as much context about a situation or problem that you're facing. \n2. Using a state of the art AI system like Claude 3 Opus, which can be as simple as copying and pasting tons of text from transcripts you've had discussing the problem or publicly available information.\n\"\nAsk the system to:\n\"\n1. Very quickly give you the gist, which is like doing a back brief, good management practice. \n2. Tease out any contradictions, interesting gaps, contrarian anomalies, or anything that grabs its attention and explain why. \n\"\nYou can meditate on those points, see if anything emerges for you, or if you get inspired. And then finally, simply ask the system to ask you hard-hitting, super precise follow-up questions that spark creative thought and critical thinking. \n\"\nBefore reading those questions, take your phone and a voice memo application like Scribe or just the Apple Voice memo app. Go for a long walk, hit record, and read each one of those questions one by one and answer them through long form monologuing until you're satisfied. \n\"\nThat process is AI at its best where it asks you questions and that stimulates your thinking at the frontiers of the problem space you're working in. Then you can take that raw material you've recorded, copy and paste it back into the ongoing chat and iterate. \n\"\nI cannot recommend cultivating this habit highly enough. You will see the quality of your work and thinking in general appreciate if you do this at least on a weekly basis.\n\"\n\"You're not using AI to think on your behalf, but to serve as a thought partner who pushes you to think even harder about the items that deserve your attention.",

So, I thought I would try to provide a bit of clarification. \"\n\"\nWhen I'm talking about \"thinking naked\" in the context of AI, I'm referring to a sort of paradox that I've encountered in using the technology more and more in interesting, different ways. Ultimately, the more, or I guess I should say \"more skillfully\", you use it, the less you actually use it. \n\"\nLiterally, you spend more time thinking about or doing things with basically zero input from AI systems. \n\"\nI've also referred to this, to the mechanism by which you get to this point, as AI acting as an \"on-ramp to a frontier.\" \n\"\nThat doesn't mean a literal physical place per se, but rather some pocket of invisible information or knowledge space that the system has never encountered based on its training data. Here, you as an embodied person grounded in reality need to conduct experiments, try things, and then make sense of whatever happens more or less on your own. \n\"\nTo put it simply, you're using AI as more of a filtering mechanism than a generative one whereby only the unresolved items that are most interesting and most important are quickly brought to your attention. Then, you need to really attend to them, which means really think hard about what the heck is actually going on and then what you should do about it. \n\"\nThat \"thinking hard\" part is more or less what I mean by \"thinking naked\". \n\"\nYou can certainly consult other folks in trying to make sense of whatever the anomalous data is, but you can't really get around the fact that you'll need to devote quite a bit of attention and work through it via your own natural faculties without machine assistance. \n\"\nIt's sort of like getting really hard-hitting, critical thinking questions in a high-quality English literature class, but applied to everything you encounter professionally. \n\"\n\"I hope that helps.",

    "content": "I'm excited to share a video I usually only send to clients:\"\n\"\nhttps://lnkd.in/eWsR8hPS\n\"\nIn it, I distill a few of my key learnings from a year+ of putting generative AI technology like GPT-4 and Claude into clients' production workflows.\n\"\nWhy share it publicly? A few reasons:\n\"\n1. The tech is evolving fast, but I think many of the core principles will endure. I want to equip more people with know-how that can make easier to experiment at any point.\n\"\n2. I believe generative AI, used well, can make us more human, not less, and I think this is a really important idea for executives to consider before embarking on an AI integration initiative. By prudently delegating certain \"word-crunching\" tasks to machines, we free ourselves and our colleagues from administrative trivia, leaving room for greater degrees of creation, relation, contemplation, and orchestration.\n\"\n3. There's so much to figure out - how to identify opportunities, manage risks, and rethink roles. We need more voices and perspectives in the conversation and a diversity of compelling visions for a future with AI; that will only happen if more folks experiment and share what they learn.\n\"\nThe video covers a lot — but, after recording it, I asked Claude to raise additional follow-up questions, and I thought I'd address a few of them:\n\"\n- How can a leader identify initial, high-leverage use cases? Start with a clear goal, an eager experimenter (maybe you!), and a task you know how to do but don't want to. Provide the AI inputs and instructions (especially via a diction tool like superwhisper) and iterate.\n\"\n- How do humans fit into the future of work? I believe we'll invest our surplus attention of energy into activities that make us more human—like relationship-building and unbounded, curiosity-driven exploration of new problem spaces outside of the model's training data. We'll likely see a re-scrambling of roles (accompanied by latent needs that will have to be met to help people retool), but also huge opportunities for greater alignment between our strengths, interests, and the provision of higher-order goods, including via unprecedentedly liquid global labor markets.\n\"\n- What are some key risks to consider right now? Beware AI hallucinations, maintain human oversight always (don't delegate decision-making per se to a machine!), and put on your \"mind armor\" when going online (ads & dis-, mis-, and malinformation are becoming more potent). \n\"\nWe're in the early innings of a long game, and as I mentioned before, it's likely the fundamental technology will evolve quite a bit even in the next few months (and so, too, my own views on the space). BUT — it's never too late to get started!\n\"\n\"So, if you give it a watch, I'd love to hear your reactions, questions, and ideas in the comments (or through a DM).",

You've basically delegated 90 plus percent of that task to a machine and done it in such a way that other people, your colleagues, and potentially folks outside of the company can use it.\n\"\nNow, on one hand, this is great, but on the other hand, it raises some really serious issues, especially for the employee, and I think it is in line with Ethan Mollick's \"secret cyborgs\" idea. \n\"\nCapital assets beget leverage, and leverage is what allows you to build a company and create and then capture outsized value. \n\"\nBut standard employment contracts are generally cash or wage-based. And, of course, most corporations are not democratically governed, certainly not by employees.\n\"\nIf employers become incentivized to completely surveil their employees, which is increasingly the case, because that data becomes raw material for AI systems to create capital assets, then employers and shareholders end up capturing the value, while employees, while potentially producing much, capture very little. \n\"\nAnd then, in the extreme, it could be the case that some sort of process, which would normally be stored in their head as latent knowledge, might be then considered work-for-hire, and an employee may not be able to take that knowledge to another company or start their own business.\n\"\nThis seems crazy, but it looks like this is where we're headed. \n\"\n\"We need new mechanisms that enable more flexible corporate governance and free participation by expert contributors, because the standard contracts we have in place that govern employer and employee relationships are simply going to start breaking, or at least making less sense, in this new AI paradigm.",

You see this already with ChatGPT Plus versus Claude Pro. They have distinct characters and strengths.\n\"\nI find myself switching between the two, depending on the nature of the task, as a function of my evolving intuition around which one is going to perform better, given what I’m trying to do.\n\"\nNow, I had a very interesting AI workshop session last week, where the team I was helping wanted to convert some of their video content into a blog post. \n\"\nAnd so we fed the inputs and the prompts to both Claude Pro and GPT-4 Turbo. And while the team generally preferred the style and tone of Claude's output, the person who was responsible for creating the blog strongly preferred the content of GPT-4 Turbo’s output.\n\"\nWe piped the output from GPT-4 Turbo into the conversation with Claude, and simply said, “we like the content of this, but the style of the output that you produced.” \n\"\nThe ultimate synthesis was significantly stronger than the original two outputs.\n\"\nThat made me wonder if we’re already at a point of differentiation between the foundation models, where it actually might make sense as a general purpose approach to kick up requests, especially when you’re trying to do something new (where there’s a decent amount of uncertainty), to each of the foundation models, and then somehow convene them in such a way that there might be a process of synthesis and you get the best parts of each output.\n\"\nOne can imagine there might be debate between foundation models, self-critiques, dialogue, etc., with a human overseeing the process.\n\"\nI think it’s not unlikely that this approach might yield better results than simply relying upon one foundation model and foundation model provider.\n\"\nThis is more expensive, of course, but given the level of complexity and potential value of effectively solving the problem or completing the task, it could very much be worth it to do it this way.\n\"\nIn the interest of imagining a potential solution, I guess it would be some kind of interface to your private data repository that acts as a facilitator and intermediary between the expert models, an orchestrator or almost like a chief-of-staff, that I could imagine might run locally on your phone or laptop or have access to your private repositories of information and then do some of the rote work of information retrieval, repackaging, routing, gathering of outputs, synthesizing, coordinating, etc.\n\"\n\"I’m going to think about this and experiment more, but would be quite curious if anybody else has thoughts or has experienced something like this — Dmitri, Ryan, Neil, and Jean especially!",

    "content": "How can you improve the quality of your conversations with AI? \"\n \n(Especially effective for Coaches & Consultants) \n \nFirstly, let’s look at what makes a coaching conversation effective: \n→ Did you ask the right questions? \n→ Did you correctly identify the bottleneck? \n→ Did you get specific information that helps you make progress? \n \nAll this happens when you’ve researched and come prepared for the call. \nBut doing this takes time for every client. \nThat’s where AI comes in! \n \nSo before we start using AI, we must clarify the goal. \n \nGoal: To use AI to prepare better & faster for coaching conversations \nHere’s the solution I propose: \n \nStep 1) Gather Context \n \nYou need to collect 3 types of information: \n \nPublic info → Social Media content, Youtube transcripts, Blogs, etc. \nPrivate info → Transcripts from your previously recorded conversations \nDictated context → A transcript of your thoughts on current context (goals, concerns, caveats, any other information) \n \nIf you haven’t already, I recommend Read AI for recording conversations & Superwhisper for dictated context. \n \nStep 2) Prepare with Claude \n \nOpen Claude & supply it with all this information. \n \nAnd then just ask claude an open-ended question: \n“I have this client meeting coming up in 20 minutes. Help me prepare.” \nNow Claude will go through the tons of information and suggest you tailored plans. \n \nI’ve seen 90-95% times, it gives pretty amazing results. \nRemember: Don’t expect magic. Expect nuggets of insights to help you think. \n \nWork with AI to design an effective conversation. \n \nStep 3) Iterate better with Claude \n \nOnce done, paste the transcript from the call in the same Claude window. \n \nThen again ask claude an open-ended question: \n“This is how the meeting went.

    "content": "*Tools for Agents, The Bitter Lesson, and What Longer Timelines Mean for AI Entrepreneurs*\"\n\"\nThe next generation of software companies will build tools for agents, not products for people.\n\"\nIf you take seriously the findings from OpenAI's Let's Verify Step-by-Step paper, along with Rich Sutton's Bitter Lesson essay (both are linked in the comments), and the rather reliable effect of Moore's Law over the next, let's say, 8 to 15 years, it seems to me that even within this new product category of \"tools for agents,\" there is an even more specific need for step-by-step validators.\n\"\nWith step-by-step validators—by packaging up proprietary technical know-how in ways that are probably slightly more sophisticated, but in line with prompt engineering—credible experts might be able to commercialize their expertise, by making these validators available in a larger machine-to-machine economy via, say, the GPT Store.\n\"\nWhen users are facing a particular problem, their personal agent, powered by the latest foundation model, can use a combination of simulated reasoning and imagination, say, by generating 10,000 possible future incremental step variations, and then calling upon the assistance of a third-party validator, which could simply just be a proprietary, fine-tuned endpoint derived from a foundation model, to gain confidence that the overall quality of the final output is high enough to be usable, enabled by significantly higher degrees of reliability per dollar compute spent for each incremental step (or in large language model nomenclature prompts in a chain).\n\"\nNow, what's interesting about this is that, again, if you take the Bitter Lesson seriously, a single user should be able to get to as good of an answer, if not better in some cases, if they simply shell out huge amounts of money on compute; eventually, this will be the dominant strategy—assuming the cost of compute and energy continues to decline—whereby a user delegates a problem to a machine that arrives at an adequate solution from first principles.\n\"\nBut, until that becomes economically viable, and for a large number of problems and tasks that we will continue to need to do over at least the next decade, it will make sense to lean on a less expensive third-party validator, than try to get to the right answer through the highly generalized first principles approach.\n\"\nOf course, this begs the question: \"How do I prepare as an entrepreneur to supply such a tool for agents?\n\"\nI would argue what I always have, which is that you should seek to solve difficult problems on the frontier of whatever topics interest you the most, specifically to further the good goals of a client, or, \"neighbor in cyberspace.\" \n\"\nThat private repository can already be leveraged for KC/KM & marketing purposes; and then, ultimately, as I've speculated above, to generate additional income through machine-to-machine micro-transactions.\n\"\n\"AGI may be coming, but when it comes to building an AI business today, hurry slowly.",

    "content": "When it comes the AI talent gap between the public and private sectors, is it possible that we could build bridges...using AI?\"\n\"\nAt last week's AI EO discussion, hosted by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), panelists fielded questions related to education & up-skilling.\n\"\nHowever, there's a glut of AI talent in the US private sector, and I have no doubt that plenty of citizens would love to contribute their skills & expertise to public service if given the chance.\n\"\nI would further hypothesize that if, with the help of generative AI, it could be made easier for Federal Government stakeholders to tap into this private talent pool in a fractional, efficient manner, the gap could be ultimately closed.\n\"\nLong-term, imagine a bounty system, not unlike Replit's market network for developers, where needs are scoped and brought to agency leadership's attention (say, by using AI to mine meeting transcripts). Select needs could be posted to a public \"micro-RFI/RFP feed,\" à la a Twitter/X account.\n\"\nPrivate citizens could respond directly—unmediated by complicated contracting vehicles—and make fractional contributions.\n\"\nAdditionally, as American workers generate publicly available information (or \"digital exhaust,\" e.g., public GitHub commit histories, long-form podcast interviews on YouTube) per participation in the remote workforce, that information could be incorporated into a qualification process—whereby the raw material is first mined by AI—that makes matching citizens to opportunities more effective.\n\"\nThis begs two additional questions:\n\"\n1. How could we keep sensitive information safe? And\n2. How might we take right-sized steps towards this broader vision?\n\"\nIn re 1, I think the ultimate answer is to give citizens the choice to opt into a background check system that leverages privacy-preserving technology and works continuously to mine their private data—kept in a \"data escrow\" built with auditable OSS—with an AI-powered fine-toothed comb, only bringing issues to the attention of investigators as needed. Ideally, this would flag small issues early, allowing for course corrections that preclude the types of errors that can slip through the cracks with traditional vetting processes that execute checks with much less frequency.\n\"\nIn re 2, to test my hypothesis, I would take the following steps:\n\"\n1. Convene a cross-functional team with the objective of, over the course of 6 months reducing time-to-resolution of an agency problem, whereby a private citizen fulfills the need and is compensated, from months to days.\n\"\n2. Create a blueprint of existing processes, e.g., hiring & onboarding, and prioritize incremental improvements with AI integration, whereby a growing portion of clerical and administrative trivia can be delegated to machines, making the overall flow of talent more efficient.\n\"\n\"3. Continuously measure the results of small-scale experiments and course-correct on a weekly basis until the objective has been achieved.",

    "content": "Get 50% of Your Time Back with AI: A Practical Framework for Business Leaders\"\n\"\nTwo weeks ago, I had the opportunity to present alongside Ryan Markman to a group of elite fractional CMOs (thanks, Rajat Kapur and &Marketing!), sharing insights I’ve gained working with AI over the past year.\n\"\nIn my portion of the presentation, I laid out a practical framework for business leaders looking to install that \"first AI outlet\" in their organizations.\n\"\nThe key insight is that done right, integrating AI into workflows and processes gives knowledge workers back 50% of their time. However, most companies flounder trying to figure out exactly how and where to implement AI capabilities.\n\"\nMy 3-level model offers guidance:\n\"\n✅ Eager Assistant: Delegate rote information retrieval, documentation and other tedious tasks to AI. This is contingent on you knowing the goals.\n\"\n🧠 Thought Partner: If goals aren't clearly defined, use conversational AI to provide clarity on objectives and strategy.\n\"\n⚡️ Electricity: Take an \"AI-native\" approach where it's embedded in everything. Build custom workflows and software to save more time.\n\"\nWhere should you start? Identify irksome tasks people have to do but don't enjoy. Find bottlenecks holding back core processes. Empower a champion user to demonstrate major productivity gains. Prove AI can deliver over 90% time savings.\n\"\nThe key is iterating quickly at first. You don't need huge teams or long development cycles. Over time the capabilities compound, more users see the benefits and adopt the tools. Eventually your workforce hits the \"screaming pain\" point if AI is taken away.\n\"\nThis practical approach allows AI to enhance human potential rather than replace jobs. The time savings let people focus on satisfying, high-leverage activities. Overall organization agility and responsiveness increase dramatically.\n\"\nI explain the framework in more detail in the accompanying video clip. Check it out and let me know your thoughts! \n\"\nAre you looking to install some \"AI outlets\" in your company? \n\"\nSend me a DM, and I’d be happy to provide guidance.\n\"",

(for OKR consulting) \n \n \nNow I was running my startup then, and I was kind of reluctant. \nBut it seemed like a low-risk thing, where I could get paid for a hobby. \nSo I said yes! \n \n \nWe started working together. \nThe engagement grew and kept growing. \nEventually, we reached a point where I helped facilitate the quarterly OKRs for the company! \n \n \nThe journey was crazy. \nBut the best part: \nI continue to work with them over 2 years later to this day. \n \n \nAnd this was how I got my start as an indie consultant after I decided to shut down my startup. \nIt was because of these existing clients, that I could quickly bounce back for round 2.0 as an entrepreneur. \n \n \nI’m forever thankful for the network I developed sharing my knowledge when I got the chance. \nI never expected anything from the presentation, but it’s safe to say that it did change my life! \nFor good. \n \n \nMoral of the story: \nThings that are obvious to you, are often valuable and not so obvious to others. \n \n \nSo share what you learn and have fun while doing so! \nYou never know what beautiful opportunities you’ll attract in the process :) \n \n \n** \nPS - My wife clicked this picture in New York when I was attending one of our AI mastermind Zoom calls! \n \nTransitioning to fully remote during the pandemic was a blessing in disguise.  \n \nBut that’s a topic for another day :) \n\"",

(This has become crystal clear to me as I've built artisanal web apps for SMBs that hook into OpenAI's APIs.)\n\"\nOn the other hand, the closer AI gets to the primary sources (with the extreme example being an always-on ambient computing device like Tab or the Humane Pin), the more value there is an a completely screenless, no-click experience.\n\"\nThe promise of the latter, a massive and I think desirable shift, necessitates solving some gnarly UX issues where the limiting factor is frontier model capability.\n\"\nMy guess is 4 isn't anywhere close to powerful enough to make this work. \n\"\nThe most basic version of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where GPT-4 queries web content via its browsing capabilities is still pretty unreliable, and reliability is a major concern with the ideal, more sophisticated RAG approach that allows GPTs safeguarding proprietary information and know-how to negotiate a mutually beneficial exchange (not unlike how we trust lawyers and business development professionals with sensitive information, assuming they'll use it optimally to further our interests).\n\"\nBut who knows? Maybe GPT-4.5/5/whatever search capabilities they're working on in the lab will sufficiently and reliably simulate imagination, reasoning, and negotiation.

    "date": "2023-12-20",
    "content": " <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4E12AQFFcLShIpiIrA\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"> <p>One of the biggest myths I'm quick to dispel when using AI is that <em>it's just like Google</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional internet search is often the model that somebody applies during their first encounter with ChatGPT because we've become used to using Google as our primary gateway to the internet over the last 20 years. The application interface looks quite similar: a text input box that would invite a short sequence of space-delimited keywords.</p>\n\n<p>However, you will have a disappointing experience if you treat tools like ChatGPT this way. You want to invert Google Search's best practices:&nbsp;<strong>more is more</strong>. The more personal, precise, and voluminous context you can provide—especially in the context of a particular goal—the more valuable the initial output and subsequent interactions will be.</p>\n\n<p>And, now that tools like ChatGPT and Claude have context windows of greater than 100,000 tokens in length (roughly equivalent to 10 or more hours of live spoken dialogue), they can become significantly more helpful when you arm them with relevant contextual data, sort of like onboarding a fractional expert with a massive onboarding document (except it's transmitted immediately).</p>\n\n<p>All that said, while ChatGPT can't and likely won't replace traditional document-based internet search, there are interesting ways to use these AI tools to accomplish search tasks per se—but not in the rote information retrieval sense. Think of this type of search as, instead, venturing out into a physical area you've never been before, a dimly lit part of the map a few hours' detour from the well-trodden area where you've been doing your knowledge work.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, what does this mean? Instead of searching for individual documents like you would with Google, I find it helpful to search for&nbsp;<em>individual thinkers</em>&nbsp;who have produced knowledge adjacent to the problem space in which I'm operating.</p>\n\n<p>A practical way to do this is to work with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_yesterday-my-client-asked-me-how-the-activity-7137440507265261568-ZZG9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">AI as a thought partner</a>, and once you've reached a point where you need help figuring out where to go next, you ask ChatGPT or Claude to imagine that it was a group dinner host. Direct it to invite five other credible (but extremely esoteric!) thinkers to discuss this very topic you're trying to make sense of at a private, off-the-record dinner where everyone could speak at length, challenge each other, and overall try to work with you in this problem space.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend pushing the AI system to find the most esoteric thinkers it can because, initially, it will shortlist guests with more mainstream ideas. That's all well and good—and perhaps good enough, depending on your level of familiarity with this particular topic—but what's likely to be better is discovering someone with pertinent, original ideas that are underrated or undervalued in mainstream discourse because they have not received much attention (yet!).</p>\n\n<p>At this point, you may seek out the seminal primary source documents they have produced (a Google Scholar search ranked by impact score or date may do the trick) and spend a little time chewing on those in the context of your problem. At that point, you're moving entirely outside the AI system, researching, reading, and \"<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_although-i-am-a-technophile-more-recently-activity-7113211460083691520-AFt_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">thinking naked</a>.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, before doing that, if you want to try to make the most of the exercise, you can ask the AI system to model a vigorous debate between all the different simulated attendees by starting with the question, \"What is one thing that you know to be true that everybody else at the table would disagree with you on?\" (AKA the famous Peter Thiel question from&nbsp;<em>Zero to One</em>).</p>\n\n<p>What's valuable about this optional exercise is that it helps you grasp the diverse perspectives (and the gaps between them) that you and your dinner guests hold on the matter at hand). This context is valuable in understanding their primary source materials before delving deeper into their positions.</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, it's essential to understand that AI systems do not work like Google's search engine, which retrieves individual documents. However, they can be used to perform&nbsp;<em>a specific type of complementary search</em>&nbsp;that may help you know where to look for primary source documents. These documents can then be retrieved, analyzed, and made useful.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, I recommend experimenting with AI systems to solve new problems and explore areas on the map of abstract information space (or \"latent space\" in AI terms) you haven't been before, starting with a simulated private dinner with esoteric thinkers who might make serendipitous contributions to your train of thought. Please keep an open mind when using these tools, understanding that you shouldn't expect to use them as a substitute for traditional search (or other media) but as complements or supplements.</p>\n\n<p>At best, you might discover new ways of interacting with information that helps you accelerate progress toward your goals. And that's how innovation happens.</p> ",

But this wasn’t the best part! \"\n \n2 hidden benefits delighted the CEO even more 👇🏻 \n \n1. “No note-taking in 1-1 meetings. It’s incredibly better to just be present in the conversation and let AI do the typing.” \n \nTips for CEOs: \n \n→ Install Read.ai/Otter.ai & start transcribing your meetings \n→ Feed the transcript to ChatGPT (or Claude or Otter AI Chat) \n→ Ask ChatGPT to summarize, derive insights, point inconsistencies, identify opportunities, and anything useful. \n→ Give ChatGPT a blank structure + 1 example. It’ll instantly convert the transcript into beautiful meeting notes. \n→ Now you can pay closer attention to the content, observe subtle cues of other attendees, and identify deeper client needs while your assistant does the note-taking. \n \n \n2. “One person on the team was initially cautious & afraid. Now she’s like, this is tremendous.” \n \nTips for CEOs: \n \n→ Identify 1 activity that is central to operations but is tedious to perform manually \n→ Figure out the information flow: Input → Process → Output \n→ Explain this process to ChatGPT and provide 3-4 varied examples \n→ Try your ChatGPT prompts & give feedback to make it better \n→ Make a video on Loom to explain your process to the team \n \nOnce your team starts using AI, they’ll be happier & more productive.  \n \nOr, as my client says: \n“Pandora’s box has been opened now & I can’t go back” \n \n*** \nI specialize in integrating AI into your Business to help you save time, grow revenues & beat the competition. 2 slots have just opened up in my schedule. \n \nWho I work with: \n→ SMB Business Owners with Remote Teams (10-200 employees) \n \n\"If you want the AI transformation, DM me “AI” and we’ll have a quick chat!",

    "title": "Go Forth and Click No More: How we can move beyond the awkwardness of chatbots and screen-based AI interactions",
    "date": "2023-11-16",
    "content": " <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4E12AQG_1sxov4iSaQ\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"> <p>One of the big problems with current AI/chat applications is that although it would seem at first glance that this would be a preferable alternative to the traditional point-and-click component-based interface because of the additional personalization and flexibility afforded to users, the truth is it actually, more often than not, introduces additional friction. This is one reason why I think, in general, the turn-your-website-into-a-chatbot approach just does not make a whole lot of sense.</p>\n\n<p>If you think about this from an ergonomics perspective, or I guess human-computer interaction more specifically, every key press, and most people still are typing, which is unfortunate because moving to dictation, especially since we have state-of-the-art models like Whisper, is just so much better once you've made the switch. But each key press to provide some kind of input probably is more cognitively taxing than a mouse click. So there's a relatively high cost in terms of cognitive load and energy from a user perspective when they're presented with a text box, let's say, versus a point-and-click interface.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is that it's open-ended, and most of the experiences I've seen require the user to initiate the conversation. And even with a few conversation starters as little components, it's just not a particularly good experience. It's like if you met somebody at a networking event, and you knew maybe a little bit about them, but they were just kind of standing in front of you, drink in hand, intensely staring at you silently, waiting for you to initiate the conversation. Like, nobody actually wants that kind of experience.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, what we'd prefer is to have somebody who knows quite a bit about us, can meet us where we are, has an understanding of our preferences, and instead of requiring us to do the hard work of figuring out how to initiate the conversation under conditions of pretty extreme uncertainty, it would be best if they actually initiated the conversation and asked us questions that got us energized because they touched directly on exactly the topics that we're interested in.</p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://x.com/curious_vii/status/1715188843211636952?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">I've written about this before</a>, but I think ultimately there are two pretty substantial personal computing shifts that need to happen for us to be able to go beyond these issues.</p>\n\n<p>The first is there needs to be some kind of login with your digital memories experience whereby you share some portion of your private digital repository, which could be maybe your emails or your search history, which of course Google has and is part of the reason why they're a trillion-dollar company. Or in the extreme, some subset of everything you've seen, said, heard, done, and so on and so forth, which will be increasingly feasible with always-on ambient computing platforms (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/humaneinc/\" target=\"_blank\">Humane™</a>'s new Pin) that are coming to market in the months and years ahead.</p>\n\n<p>The second issue is that screen-based interfaces are, I think, never really going to be a perfect fit for this kind of discursive experience. And really for it to work, we've got to be able, willing, and desire a more radical switch to primarily voice interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Now, that's great when it comes to input because it's actually significantly less cognitively taxing to speak at length than it is to type. And I would argue probably even to point and click because you can be almost purely in a production mode and not distracted by whatever's on the screen in front of you.</p>\n\n<p>So that's great. But on the flip side, when it comes to consumption of information, primarily through an audio interface, meaning text-to-speech or something spoken, the threshold in terms of overall intelligence and reliability of pertinent, relevant, useful, and interesting responses from the AI assistant counterparty is extremely high.</p>\n\n<p>And although I'm pretty impressed by what's already possible with assistants like <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/inflectionai/\" target=\"_blank\">Inflection AI</a>'s Pi that ask you questions by default, which I think is an absolutely brilliant user experience choice, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a>'s nascent voice-only interface through the ChatGPT app, my suspicion is that getting to the point that people are en masse willing to make that switch to a voice-first medium when it comes to using networked personal computers is going to be quite, quite high.</p>\n\n<p>And we may end up running into a series of technical problems that delay the adoption of this technology and prevent it from having to be integrated into our lives in a way that really unlocks unprecedented productivity, similar to how it's taken much longer for self-driving cars to reach the level of reliability that consumers and regulators expect.</p>\n\n<p>Or, in the case of spatial computing or virtual reality technology, the user experience thresholds around things like latency, which has to be super, super short to prevent cybersickness, or the incredibly high resolution screens that we need, spatial audio requirements, device weight, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So basically, what I'm saying is, I think it's difficult, but certainly not impossible, especially in highly specific and tailored use cases, to leverage AI in a way that really improves workflow experiences, especially for knowledge workers who are encumbered by clerical and administrative tasks, and primarily use a point-and-click keyboard and mouse-based, screen-based personal computing environment.</p>\n\n<p>But I think for us to really take things to the next level, there has to be this more radical shift to a voice-first interface. And again, for the reasons that I described above, and also because on the consumption side, bandwidth is much higher when you're reading text, especially if you're hopping and skipping across documents, versus having to listen very intently to a voice assistant. The relative quality of what's compressed into every single word that you would listen to versus what you could skim over as you're browsing the web or your private document store is extremely, extremely high.</p>\n\n<p>And these are all challenges that I think will be overcome, but it really, you know, if we're to learn from virtual reality or self-driving cars, it could be significantly longer to squeeze out those last few percentage points of reliability and quality before this revolutionary technology really starts to making a meaningful impact.</p>\n\n<p>We shall see.</p> ",

Or a thought partner. Or even as electricity.</a></p>\n\n<p>More recently, I've also begun thinking about AI is as a \"<strong>compressor that begets expansion</strong>.\"</p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<p>Well, I think there's a lot of confusion about the (ultimately paradoxical) centralizing/decentralizing effects of AI that needs to be cleared up.</p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, AI enables nodes in a network (and power centers more generally) to become significantly more efficient by:</p><ol><li><blockquote><p>Unsticking tacit knowledge</em> that was difficult or impossible to codify and instrumentalize and</p></li><li><p>Consequently <em>freeing up core inputs</em> (in the case of information and knowledge, human cognition and attention, especially).</p></li></ol><p>These freed up inputs, no longer a limiting factor for the efficient operation (and, under certain circumstances, continued expansion) of leaner and more muscular institutions, expand osmotically to new frontiers — particularly new frontiers in latent space, where intrinsic motivation guides individuals, unencumbered thanks to the internet and digital media by the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_people-are-able-to-earn-people-are-able-activity-7104940424598802434-ekTu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">traditional barriers of time, space, culture, and language</a>, to organize into small and sometimes short-lived teams with a common mission.</p>\n\n<p>Humanity would, at this point, be operating at unprecedented speed and scale, likely necessitating new coordination mechanisms that allow for highly liquid global labor markets and nimble navigation of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exaptive-economy-accelerating-innovation-bridging-divide-ulstrup\" target=\"_blank\">the liminal space between private and public goods</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Public blockchain ledgers, Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machines-markets-microtransactions-role-exaptive-economy-ulstrup\" target=\"_blank\">start to make a lot more sense</a> — not just as rails for financial transactions, but as a robust lattice that begets accelerating collaboration and creativity online.</p>\n\n<p>By allowing power centers to make significantly more efficient \"in-distribution\" predictions, AI actually has a decentralizing effect, liberating humans to explore new frontiers in unprecedentedly diverse and inclusive bands of internet-native explorers making sense of \"out-of-distribution\" pockets of reality.</p>\n\n<p><em>But what about surveillance; feasibility, tech, and timelines; and the issue of putting this into practice?</p></blockquote><p>To address each:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Surveillance</strong>: Panopticon is coming. But the ways in which it could emerge are quite diverse—from top-down (e.g., single institutions claim a monopoly on social credit scores and levers they can use to expand or restrict access to capital, information, etc.) to bottoms-up (AI-powered ambient wearables like the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/humaneinc/\" target=\"_blank\">Humane™</a> pin become the norm; real privacy comes at a premium OR it can be found on the encrypted fringes of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjPmb6-zbyCAxWQF1kFHYoIDg4QwqsBegQIDRAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DurtXRg9Nl3k&usg=AOvVaw0285CrJ8BUa4ucj44W4uvK&opi=89978449\" target=\"_blank\">pseudonymous economy</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>Tech & timelines</strong>: A nontrivial amount of crypto activity is criminal or speculative (sometimes both).

A lot of work is clerical and administrative. It needs to get done, and people know how to do it, but no one particularly wants to.

Going deeper into reality is one of our deepest human desires, and once you've had the opportunity to explore it for yourself, those quotidian vices and cheap imitations lose their luster.</p>\n\n<p>That said, if there's one thing you take away from my posts on LinkedIn and elsewhere over the past year as I've tried to make sense of everything I've experienced on the AI frontier, it's an invitation to really consider the following question:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>When AI affords you the ability to become 2–20x as efficient and digital media becomes more immersive, discursive, and personal, what are you going to do with all that extra time?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7067540363019784193?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7067540363019784193%29\" target=\"_blank\">Something to really think about</a> as we reach the close of 2023 and look forward to things getting even more interesting in 2024...</p> ",

Data that is novel and interesting and compressible. Data acquired through the process of solving real problems for real people that have never been solved before (NOT decadent ZIRP wealth transfer schemes).\n\"\nIf you digitize the result and the process across a wide range of scenarios (given one or two dimensions held constant), you'll have nearly everything you need to create a capital asset that fits into the AI value chain; I anticipate that there will be interesting and novel business models that enable the commercialization of that data as it inevitably moves along the gradient of private to public good.\n\"\nIn practice, this gives us three questions to consider:\n\"\n1. Am I, an entrepreneur building software, building something that will be commoditized by and absorbed into the foundation model borg?\n\"\n2.

    "content": "What does the long-term AI-human worker relationship look like?\"\n\"\nHard to know exactly, but I am sure of one thing: the future of knowledge work is going very different than the past.\n\"\nHere's the million-dollar question for managers and specialists: Once AI can do knowledge work on par with the median person, how does one decide when to kick up a task to a human expert?\n\"\nHere's what got me thinking about this...\n\"\nPersonally, as I've come to experiment more frequently with Anthropic's Claude-as-sales-coach, it seems likely to me that more services will be brought \"in-house.\n\"\nThis would dovetail nicely with an uptick in \"solopreneurship\" (and the emergence of global liquid labor markets where contractors flit between projects for a wide variety of clients as white collar workers are shed by leaner, more muscular, AI-powered enterprises facing cost pressures for the first time in a generation due to sustained elevated interest rates will increasingly need to retool and reenter the workforce) since support functions, from rote administration all the way to specializations like sales coaching, can be reliably delegated to machines.\n\"\nAnd while, yes, a great sales coach has Claude beat on most dimensions, it's hard to compete on speed and cost — $20 a month for Claude Pro and two minutes to copy-and-paste meeting transcripts later, I had B- to B+ actionable takeaways and a nice back-and-forth that gave me a bit more self-awareness.\n\"\nCompare that to working with a human coach, which could take weeks if not months to get value, is $100s to $1000s of dollars, lacks the degree of context Claude does (they're not going to review hours of tape), and isn't necessarily of good quality — very difficult to know if someone's going to be good or not without a word-of-mouth introduction from someone who knows both parties well, at least for now.\n\"\nSo - how would the escalation mechanics actually work when going from AI to human? And how is it even going to be possible to transfer sufficient context? People are bottlenecked in re information consumption to a much greater degree than machines, so the human will never \"know\" as much as the AI surrogate, meaning the nature of the tasks they tackle will have to be fundamentally different.\n\"\nWill experts be forced to operate at higher levels of complexity to stay competitive? Will a career track look more like an ascent through degrees of competence and breadth via orchestration of AI agents versus the traditional (in some industries) focus on depth? Is it possible that it's somehow both?\n\"\n\"Strange times ahead as we deal with this emergent complexity! And possibly soon if AGI really does arrive before the end of the decade!",

Will there be any opportunities left for enterprise software startups to capture value around AI?\"\n\"\nThere’s still a lot to figure out in regards to permissioning and access, especially as labor markets become more liquid and enterprises decide whether to hitch their wagons to a single foundation model or myriad (including private OSS variants).\n\"\nFor example, if a contractor is brought on board for a short-term project, they should be able to converse with the company’s data or AI system. This would allow them to get pertinent information that helps them achieve a result without much mediation by human managers.\n\"\nAt the same time, of course, it would be imprudent to give them access to everything. So, figuring out how to strike the right balance in a generalizable way is, I think, going to be a pretty gnarly problem.\n\"\nAnd I would bet that there are commercial opportunities to help enterprises, large and small, navigate that liminal space.

    "content": "“CMOs are being told, ‘You have to accomplish more with less.’ But, personalization and quality content require major time and effort…that's when it makes sense to take AI seriously.”\"\n\"\nLindsey Scheftic is the former CMO of Ring (and an Apple & Red Bull alumna). We recently spoke about the challenges marketing executives face in 2023 and whether AI can help.\n\"\nI've been working with AI since I was at MIT and came armed with plenty of questions.\n\"\nHere are 3 key takeaways:\n\"\n1. CMOs are now expected to do more with less.\n\"\nCMOs are under serious pressure. They're expected to publish more content AND raise the bar on campaign performance. At the same time, budgets are being slashed.\n\"\nThankfully, marketers can use AI to deliver higher-quality, personalized content that strengthens customer relationships.\n\"\nTeams can also use AI to get more actionable insights from campaign data, faster—but only if they're given the right tools and adequate training.\n\"\n2. Marketers know that AI is important; but, they’re behind on training and adoption.\n\"\nPer a recent survey by the Marketing AI Institute, 64% of marketers see AI as “crucial for success,” but 78% admit they “lack adequate training.”\n\"\nWith so much noise around AI, it's difficult for CMOs to know where to invest their team’s scarce attention.\n\"\nIn my experience integrating AI into >20 businesses, for an initiative to pay off, the technology needs to fit comfortably into existing workflows. The devil is in the details.\n\"\nFor a cross-functional marketing team, those details will vary across Operations, Creative, Production, Strategy, Customer Research, and Acquisition.\n\"\nNo wonder a team-wide AI initiative can seem impossibly complex.\n\"\n3. For long-term success, don’t be afraid to start small.\n\"\nIn her last CMO role, Lindsey found early traction through an AI pilot. She helped analysts quickly analyze a massive dataset of interview transcripts. They used custom tooling to rapidly surface insights, faster than ever before.\n\"\nThis initial demonstration made it clear, even to the most conservative marketers, that AI could be made immediately useful. That quick win built confidence and fueled additional interest.\n\"\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\"\nMarketers already have to deal with a sky-high MarTech stack; the idea of taking on yet another tool can feel overwhelming.\n\"\nThat’s why I’m teaming up with Lindsey to make AI adoption dead simple with personalized, results-driven AI workshops for CMOs, senior marketing, and media and advertising leadership.\n\"\nWe’re combining my experience building generative AI solutions for clients across industries (from defense to healthcare services to private equity) with her unparalleled experience as a marketing leader and pioneer.\n\"\nIf you’re a CMO who’s curious about AI and would like to understand how you can help your team do more, better, faster, via a personalized, no-nonsense private working session, reach out!\n\"",

The goal is to lift burdens, not compete.\n\"\n⏱️ Organizations shouldn't wait for the mythical \"perfect moment\" to understand employee motivations. Assess constantly with confidential pulse surveys.\n\"\n🗺️ To drive rapid change, identify \"pioneers\" who get a thrill from trailblazing vs trying to convince the skeptics.\n\"\n✍️ Leaders shouldn't just communicate the \"what\", but the \"why\" of change repeatedly.

Twitter has high-signal AI communities.\n\"\nYesterday, inspired by the recursive approach of the new \"Chain of Density\" article summarization prompt, I used Anthropic's AI, Claude, to summarize an almost two-hour, wide-ranging discussion I had with fellow AI enthusiast and The AI Exchange member Charlie Treadwell.\n\"\nClaude took the transcript, and with the following prompt (then 7 cycles through a self-referential loop), managed to squeeze it into a summary just 0.5% the size of the original:\n\"\nYou are the world's most efficient YouTube transcript compression algorithm. I want you to engage in a recursive process, whereby I will initially give you the entire transcript of a YouTube video, and then you will compress the contents of that video into a summary that captures the key essential points of the video. And then you will compare that summary to the original transcript and find room for improvement in terms of compressing more signal with greater precision into your summary. The goal here is to pack as much information as is physically possible into as few words as you can. Your goal is to ultimately achieve Kolmogorov complexity with your summary. If there is signal present in the original transcript that was not in the summary, then make sure it is accounted for in the subsequent summary. If there is room for additional compression, say by getting the same message across in fewer or more precise words, then do that. You have the world's greatest vocabulary. You are an expert, so how you go about doing this is up to you. Then, once you've found ways to improve the summary and you've listed those, you will ask me if I would like to proceed. I will confirm, and you will do this process again, comparing then your new summary to the last summary, again to the original transcript, and then finding, again, room for improvement. I am going to tell you to repeat this process until you have achieved Kolmogorov complexity.\n\"\nColor me impressed; per Charlie: \"Nice summary.\n\"\n(Try it yourself: copy and paste the prompt above + the full transcript from a YouTube video or your most recent meeting, and tell Claude to \"repeat\" until you're satisfied.)\n\"\nWhy does this matter?

(It’s that liminal online/offline space in between the ends of a barbell-shaped relationship with digital media that cognition gets mixed up.) I would counsel other AI enthusiasts to consider taking a disciplined approach to going tech-less: front-loading workdays with unmediated contemplation.\n\"\nWhy?\n\"\nWell, there are, broadly, two modes of knowledge work: that which generates experimental data and that which makes sense of it (which then precedes another round of contact with reality, segued via hypothesis generation—and so on). This is all towards the end of knowledge production—and, when we're especially fortunate, meaning-making. Those heuristics one discovers to work with a degree of reliability in his or her quest to move a particular project forward are the source of differentiated leverage (and, for commercial purposes, profit); if this technē can also be made generally useful as a capital and/or public good, it helps us all move THE project forward by catalyzing other seekers as they respectively drive toward—in machine learning terms—“compression progress.”\n\"\nMy personal experience would lead me to believe that dedicating time before noon to thinking, simply, sometimes for hours before uttering a single word (though occasionally supported by committing a subset of these thoughts to “short-term memory” in slow longhand, e.g., attached) is an essential complement to those AI-as-rocket-fuel hyper-divergent/convergent excursions through latent space.\n\"\nGoing without said time for too long inevitably leads to cognitive fragmentation and some variation of \"TikTok brain\"; no one wants this.\n\"\nAbout two weeks ago, I broke a cardinal rule: “Do not check your email (let alone Twitter!) until 1pm. This became a habit, and I allowed my precious morning attention to be swallowed by a queue of digital trivia.\n\"\nIt wasn’t until today, just after sunrise in the quiet car of the Amtrak to Penn Station, that I was able to bring order to the various data spread across clients, industries, and disparate domains that had accumulated at the periphery of my mind’s eye.\n\"\nThose first fifteen minutes of raw boredom—that paradoxical sensation of over- and under-stimulation—were, as they always are, uncomfortable; but, insights  emerged (as they always do), and in stark contrast to the brief thrill (and flood of cortisol) that comes with diving into my email queue, I am sated; I have no regrets.\n\"\n\"In the long-term, I hope that AI becomes nigh-invisible, and we can usher in a long-prophesied “calm computing” paradigm; until then, here’s a friendly PSA: remember to periodically remove the exocortex, be bored, and think for yourself.",

AI helps you see moves you never even knew existed.\"\n\"\nI recently spoke with Jean Marc Goguikian, CEO at Konko.ai.\n\"\nOur conversation wasn't just about task automation. It was also about AI's potential to help us make better decisions under conditions of extreme uncertainty and complexity, thanks to broad-ranging simulations with \"synthetic humans.\n\"\nWhile, yes, AI models trained on your data will be able to draft your emails, they’ll also be able to run high-dimensional multi-agent simulations, offering you a wide range of scenarios and analyses for critical business decisions (eg., preparing to have a tough conversation with a client or colleague).\n\"\nWe also discussed what he's learned from enterprise buyers about the remaining barriers to enterprise integration: data security and change management are still significant hurdles, but they are not insurmountable. \n\"\nOf similar importance is the ubiquitous need for thoughtful partnerships between AI providers and businesses (from SMBs to enterprises) interested in using the technology to catalyze their strategic initiatives and solve real problems (not just razzle dazzle with shiny tech).\n\"\nSo, what's next? Where should we expect to see the next great companies come into being as the next generation of AI technology comes online?\n\"\nJean-Marc emphasized the opportunity that lies in making AI accessible to the early majority, not just the innovators. The next s-curve of AI innovation is likely not about the creation of more complex toolsets; it'll be about crafting user-friendly yet powerful solutions that leverage the technology in nigh-invisible ways.\n\"\n\"🔗 Want more insight?

    "content": "“With AI, the only constant is change; the focus should be on solving problems.”\"\n\"\nI recently had a compelling conversation with Karl Yeh, another indie consultant helping business owners take advantage of the latest generation of AI.\n\"\nHere are some of the core insights that came up during our discussion:\n\"\n1️⃣ Change is Inherent to the Technology\n\"\nWhat It Means: AI is evolving at an unprecedented rate. As new foundation models come online, their capabilities are distributed almost instantaneously, meaning the cycle time between breakthrough and implementation CAN be unprecedentedly short.\n\"\nWhy It Matters: Committing to a particular technology is likely not a sound strategic decision, as something better is likely to come online soon (and probably sooner than you think).\n\"\n2️⃣ AI is a Means to a Real-World End\n\"\nWhat It Means: For implementations to succeed, consultants should focus on what the client is seeking to achieve with AI, and then run quick, iterative experiments to assess technical feasibility without getting lost in the technical weeds.\n\"\nWhy It Matters: The better the technology works, the more invisible it becomes. Staying focused on the end goal mitigates the risk of getting sidetracked by shiny AI toys (and premature optimization rabbit holes) and ensures better results for all parties—in both the short- and the long-run.\n\"\n3️⃣ No Experts, Only Pioneers\n\"\nWhat It Means: Expertise in AI is more about a process of continuous learning and experimentation than having a set of fixed knowledge.\n\"\nWhy It Matters: Setting realistic expectations is crucial (there will be bugs!), but there’s also the exciting possibility of uncovering unexpected, groundbreaking capabilities during the engagement.\n\"\n4️⃣ Cut Through the Hype\n\"\nWhat It Means: While chatbots are often touted as the future, customer-facing chatbot technology, even with the latest LLMs, still leaves a lot to be desired; this is true of other \"sexy\" AI use cases that get a lot of attention in the media.\n\"\nWhy It Matters: Focusing on unsexy but effective internal workflow automation and business operations is a pragmatic approach that can deliver robust, immediate value.\n\"\n5️⃣ Workflow Integration\n\"\nWhat It Means: Changing someone’s workflow is a big ask. Meeting users where they are before asking them to make a significant change (or even a seeming insignificant one, like opening a new window) is essential.\n\"\nWhy It Matters: Making AI accessible within existing workflows (like Slack or Teams) can significantly ease the transition and increase adoption. Great tip, Karl Yeh !\n\"\n\"I really enjoyed my conversation with Karl and look forward to sharing more insights that emerge from our future conversations, as well as those with other practitioners in the space, as we all experiment and learn together in real time on the #AI frontier.",

    "content": "I often get asked how I concretely use AI as a thought partner, which is one of my favorite use cases to actually get more work done and elevate the quality of my ideas.\"\n\"\nThe obvious and immediate way to use AI is for drafting content. While that’s a great use case, you can actually engage with the technology more discursively. This helps improve the quality of what you post, share, or send by augmenting the robustness of your ideas with technology-assisted critical reasoning and reflection.\n\"\nI just recorded a short video showing you exactly how I do this in practice. I literally did this this morning just on my phone, and I’m going to include a link to the chat if you’d like to see the entire chat in full.\n\"\nAnyway, I know a lot of my posts are sort of abstract, so I thought I would make this as concrete as possible.

    "content": "💪 Getting 10x Gains from AI: The Power of Ambitious Goals and Extreme Constraints 🤖\"\n\"\nI recently had an insightful conversation with Don Campbell about how to get more than just incremental improvements from AI.\n\"\nWe explored an approach I've found highly effective: pairing extremely ambitious goals with tight constraints on time and resources.\n\"\nCounterintuitively, this forces the type of radical rethinking that enables you to leapfrog vs incrementally progress.\n\"\nLet me explain...\n\"\nI first tried this approach at the beginning of the year, when a client reached out with an urgent request for AI assistance on a substantial deliverable for one of their clients with a fast-approaching deadline.\n\"\nI gave myself just 2 hours to build a data transformation script in Python for a client the output of which would normally have taken a human expert an entire day to complete.\n\"\nI promised the client a particular, quantifiable result by COB with a money-back guarantee. By relentlessly leveraging AI and coding tools like GPT-4 and GitHub Copilot, I delivered the desired outcome faster than either of us frankly thought would have been possible (and definitely wouldn't have been without AI).\n\"\nEven more powerful has been using this approach to create \"artisanal software\" for another client.\n\"\nEach week, I work live with a master operator at the company I'm serving to discover a problem in their workflow, design and build a solution, and ship it to production on the very same day.\n\"\nWe recently achieved this entire end-to-end innovation cycle in less than 60 minutes - discovering, designing, developing and deploying a completely customized web application feature, a process that in my decade of product experience would have taken weeks and a cross-functional team even just a few months ago.\n\"\nWhy does this work?\n\"\nAmbitious goals force you to deeply examine what would need to be true to achieve them. Extreme constraints leave no choice but to try creative new techniques. The combination drives breakthrough re-architectures.\n\"\nThe key is maintaining a \"hypergrowth mindset\" - lofty goals to push your limits, plus humility to learn from AI, even in areas where you're an expert. While you're in the zone, look for 10x contributions aligned to business objectives; delegate rote tasks to machines.\n\"\nThis compounding approach has transformed how I innovate with AI. I believe it can unlock new levels of transformational value for any leader or organization.\n\"\nAs you explore the potential of AI, try setting more ambitious targets under tighter constraints.\n\"\nThe breakthroughs may surprise you!\n\"\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this technique - please like/comment!\n\"\n\"And thanks to Don Campbell for the thought-provoking discussion.",

    "content": "“People are able to earn; people are able to learn. You can do everything there [on Twitter].”\"\n\"\nI recently had a fascinating conversation with GEORGE WANDHE, a Kenyan software engineer and CS student whose story is an illustrative example of how IT (and AI in particular) is reshaping traditional career pathways.\n\"\nWhat sets George apart is his ability to harness the power of platforms like Replit to secure paid programming gigs, build a portfolio, and accelerate his education in new, specialized fields like AI and backend Python development — and inspire his classmates to do the same.\n\"\n🛠️ The Role of Replit and Bounty Systems\n\"\nInstead of traditional summer internships, George started by taking on small bounties on Replit. Over time, he demonstrated his credibility and reliability. Replit gave him the dual advantage of offering the tooling required to complete tasks and connecting him to economic opportunities through their bounty system. The platform became a meritocratic space where he could showcase his skills, independent of factors like educational background and location.\n\"\n🐦 Twitter (now X) as a Multipurpose Tool\n\"\nGeorge also leverages Twitter, not just as a space for networking and business opportunities but also as a source of practical knowledge. Through intentional curation, he gains access to a wealth of educational content from AI practitioners globally, propelling both his learning and earning capacities. It’s easy to dunk on Twitter (and social media more broadly) as a source of distraction and/or disinformation; George’s experience shows that, with the right perspective and intentions, it can unlock economic and educational opportunities.\n\"\n🤖 The Role of AI Tooling\n\"\nIntegrated AI tools like Replit’s Ghostwriter and ChatGPT Plus further supercharge learning for engineers like George. These tools serve as a “personalized tutors,” helping practitioners make sense of complex knowledge bases, new APIs, and more — ”AI-as-thought-partner” ultimately allows individuals to connect mind and hand more robustly, across a wider range of problems.\n\"\n🌍 The Implications\n\"\nGeorge’s experiences represent what I perceive as a forthcoming seismic shift in how we should think about employment, education, and economic mobility:\n1. A trend toward more fluid, global labor markets.\n2. A shift from traditional education pathways to more specialized, real-world experiences.\n3. The role of AI as a personal thought partner and workforce multiplier.\n4. The changing dynamics of employment, moving from full-time roles to a more “liquid workforce.”\n\"\nIn the longer term, we might see “liquid teams” come together to solve specific problems, compensated according to real-world results, rather than time invested (or outputs, for that matter).\n\"\n\"As we ponder the future of work, George's story offers us a compelling glimpse of what's possible at the intersection of AI and this new generation of digital natives, able to work from anywhere.",

    "content": "“You've really opened my eyes to what's possible when you reduce the time-to-capability side of the equation… That surprised me the most.” — Nikhil Shenoy, CEO of Colvin Run Networks, Inc.\"\n\"\nOver three months, I’ve had the pleasure of serving the team at Colvin Run as they drive innovation in the defense sector with cutting-edge technology, including generative AI.\n\"\nArmed with the hands-on experience I’ve had helping clients (and myself) become more efficient by delegating clerical tasks to AI since ChatGPT was launched late last year (and nearly a decade of prior product management experience), I had a strong hunch that we’d be able to move at unprecedented speed in building a v1 prototype.\n\"\nBut, even with that hunch, I didn’t realize just how fast a small agile team can move when they’re armed with AI tools that plug into the product development process itself.\n\"\nFrom transcription and analysis of discovery interviews to GPT-4 (and Code Interpreter especially!) for translating plain English into boilerplate code to improving & refactoring that code with GitHub Copilot, all of those little productivity boosts add up—and we were able to create a tangible application, ready for real-world contact, in just a few hours.\n\"\nIf there’s one thing I hope other executives might take away from our experience, it’s this: When it comes to setting the bar in re a your AI initiative, RAISE YOUR EXPECTATIONS!\n\"\nInnovators can bootstrap software prototypes into existence and iterate faster than ever—it is even now possible to make and deploy live code changes in response to live end-user feedback.\n\"\nThis means that you should expect value from AI initiatives on day 1.\n\"\nWe are truly at the beginning of an innovation explosion: Custom software/information technology development capabilities that were only available to major corporations and equity-financed tech companies over the past few decades are now feasible for SMBs (and even sole proprietors) who want to move forward on the frontier and scale their operations with bespoke software that helps make operators more productive and gives executives their invaluable time back.\n\"\nAre you ready to start integrating AI into your business?\n\"\n\"Add your thoughts in a comment below!",

    "content": "🔮💼🧠 Where can you start integrating AI into your work to unlock more energy, productivity, and satisfaction?\"\n\"\nI've developed a simple heuristic to answer this question. It involves a journey back through your calendar and a deep dive into your to-do list. The aim? To identify the activities that give you energy and those that drain it from you. Imagine spending 80% of your work week doing what you love while delegating the rest to AI! 🚀\n\"\nSo, how does it work? 🤔\n\"\n1️⃣ Take a trip through your calendar from the past 1-4 weeks. Identify events that left you feeling energized and vitalized. These are tasks you don't want to delegate. Now imagine doing more of them.\n\"\n2️⃣ Next, identify the events that left you feeling drained. These are ideal candidates for delegation to AI. With the right tools, you can automate up to 80% of these tasks.\n\"\n3️⃣ Finally, identify the tasks that consistently fall to number two on your to-do list. You know the ones I mean - necessary but not particularly rewarding tasks. These too are ripe for AI automation.\n\"\nThis process opens the door to a virtuous cycle. By delegating the draining tasks to AI, you free up resources to focus on the tasks that give you energy. Over time, this leads to increased productivity, satisfaction, and a lot more of your time back! ⏳\n\"\nI've encapsulated this process into a handy ChatGPT applet. This AI coach will guide you through this self-discovery journey and help you identify where you can integrate AI into your workflows. The outcome? More time and energy to do the things that truly matter to you.\n\"\nGive it a try! You might surprise yourself with the insights you gain. And once you've taken this journey, why not share a summary of what you learned as a comment on this post?\n\"\n👉 https://lnkd.in/dRxA4qrG\n\"\nHere's to becoming not just more productive, but happier and more satisfied at work! 🥂\n\"\n\"#AIIntegration #Productivity #WorkSatisfaction #ChatGPT #AI",

    "content": "The amount of free leverage available to anyone with a bit of agency and a ChatGPT Plus sub is unreal. 🚀\n\"\nIt's a low hanging fruit free for all out there. 🍎\n\"\nI posted this on Twitter (X?), and a curious mind 🧠 asked me to share some less-known paths to low-hanging AI fruit.\n\"\n🌳 After months of mind-melding with the machines (and teaching clients how to do the same), here are my top 6 tips:\n\"\n1️⃣ Uploading zips of entire repositories to the code interpreter. It's like having an entire digital product team at your disposal - an expert designer, a senior engineer, and a product manager who can provide concrete feedback on how to take your code to the next level. 🏢👩‍💻\n\"\n2️⃣ Bypassing traditional data connectors and reporting layers to create completely custom reports and memos. Dramatically improve insight generation and reporting throughput without waiting days or weeks for a team of analysts or data scientists. Just ask questions in natural language that you're personally curious about and get good information. 💡📈\n\"\n3️⃣ Open-ended thought partnership conversations with GPT-4 through the iOS whisper feature. It's like having a personal mentor, helping you overcome the blank page/cold start problem when tackling a new project. 🗨️👁️\n\"\n4️⃣ Creating system architecture diagrams, based on chunks of a transcript of a live conversation with an end user. With the \"show me\" plugin (my favorite among all the ChatGPT Plus plugins), you can visualize complex structures on the fly. It's like having a live, interactive whiteboard session with an expert. 🗣️🎨\n\"\n5️⃣ Rapidly iterating through variables for mid-journey prompts by discussing your aesthetic preferences. It's like having an incredibly imaginative thought partner who can help you explore your ideas by translating them into symbols and images that stretch the boundaries of your imagination. 💭🚀\n\"\n6️⃣ Asking GPT-4 to suggest obscure but credible thinkers who have published papers on the precise combination of topics you're currently interested in. It's almost like having a panel of credible experts ready to engage in an impassioned debate to accelerate your journey towards a new pocket at the frontiers of human knowledge. 📚🧪\n\"\nWhat's missing from this list?\n\"\nWhat other low-hanging fruit should more motivated, AI-savvy knowledge workers reach for?\n\"\n\"#ai #artificialintelligence",

The contrast and potential harmony between these trajectories could redefine our relationship with AI, altering how we think, work, and create.\n\"\nDetails: AI is descending Plato’s Pyramid, becoming more probabilistic and adaptive, resembling early stages of human cognition. This trend points to a future where AI handles tasks traditionally requiring human-like flexibility, freeing us for more complex cognitive endeavors.\n\"\nRelevance: For businesses and individuals, this progression suggests AI could become an even more integral part of our cognitive processes. AI tools could aid in making sense of complex systems, facilitating decision-making, and fueling creativity. The challenge lies in ensuring alignment with human values and maintaining transparency in AI decision-making.\n\"\nRelevant Quote: “Looking forward, it’s possible we might see the progression of both humans and AI toward a point of integration, where AI evolves to complement and augment human intelligence across the spectrum of cognitive tasks.” – ChatGPT\n\"\nCritical Thinking Question: If we extend Plato’s Pyramid of Thought beyond the traditional four levels, into a future of integrated human and AI cognition, what ethical, societal, and technological challenges might we face, and how can we prepare for them?\n\"\n\"https://lnkd.in/eFmcyu_s",

    "content": "Is there room for a new ”I” in the trust equation?\"\n\"\nHere's why we shouldn't JUST focus on Intimacy; \"Interestingness\" can help build trust, too. Let's discover how pursuing unique interests can amplify your trustworthiness.\n\"\nThe trust equation: Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation is a widely accepted concept, especially in the professional sphere. But what if we replaced \"Intimacy\" with \"Interestingness\"?\n\"\nWhile \"Intimacy\" can feel nebulous in a business context, \"Interestingness\"—defined as nurturing a unique, reality-anchored perspective—is something even people who aren't \"people people\" can actively cultivate.\n\"\nIt's tempting to mistakenly equate being \"interesting\" with adopting a contrarian stance, but I propose a different approach. Cultivating interestingness involves self-discovery, understanding our intrinsic motivations, and using them to traverse unexplored territory on the frontier of human knowledge and experience.\n\"\nThere, we may unearth pockets of insight where conventional heuristics fail, offering unique perspectives that others value. Ultimately, adopting a contrarian stance would only be an accidental consequence of making a tremendous discovery.\n\"\nThis journey makes us not just interesting but also trustworthy. Our unique insights become valuable, we become more credible, and our intrinsic motivation creates an authenticity that enhances intimacy.\n\"\nTo become more trustworthy, ask yourself, “What totally fascinates me?” and pursue it. Discover and seek to answer questions no one has ever asked; keep moving forward, relentlessly.\n\"\nI suspect that \"Interestingness\" might correlate with lower self-orientation. Someone with the freedom and the intrinsic motivation to venture along their unique path is less likely to be primarily driven by mimetic competition for limited resources like money or status; they are led instead by curiosity.\n\"\nIn conclusion, supplementing \"Intimacy\" with \"Interestingness\" in the trust equation is an actionable idea that can help you become more trustworthy: Investing some of your invaluable attention each week (à la Google's 20% time) into hyper-individuated exploration, experimentation, and discovery for its own sake.\n\"\nWhat do you think?

It always took advertisers' and the platforms' objectives into account, often as the primary drivers of index design.\n\"\nNow, it looks like we'll be paying for what we consume when it comes to AI, which means we'll be adding \"AI\" to our monthly utility expenditures along with gas and electricity. This is ultimately good: We won't have to worry (at least not as much) that our \"machine-generated indices\" are working more in the interest of a third-party's rather than our own.\n\"\nOn the other hand, this means that unifying narratives (interpretations of events) will likely fragment further, and reasoning errors are likely to compound as some people choose to prefer indices that reinforce their beliefs, rather than test hypotheses in the interest of achieving real-world results.\n\"\nThat said, I remain extremely optimistic about the upside of this unprecedented power to process, prioritize, and present information straight from the source, especially for the next generation that learns how to harness these technologies to make sense of pockets of information on the frontier of human knowledge!\n\"\n\"As context windows expand, inference speeds increase, and per-token prices drop, we'll see huge impact from AI-enabled personalized indexing.",

In fact, it's probably the least interesting way to use the technology.\n\"\nThanks to tools like ElevenLabs, Midjourney, Kaiber, Runway's GEN-2, D-ID, Meta's MusicML, the cost of multimedia post-production is dropping like a rock.\n\"\nThat means you can take any idea and weave it into an attention-grabbing content nugget, perfectly tailored to fit the constraints of your public channel of choice (LinkedIn in my case).\n\"\nWhat does that mean for the future of content marketing (and marketing in general)?\n\"\nWell, when charisma is commoditized, the the differentiator that matters will be the core information—and, to anyone who has a love/hate relationship with digital media, this is a GOOD thing.\n\"\nYou won't have to hire an expensive agency to start publishing content. All you have to do is \"mine reality\" by tapping into the pool of digitized raw material that, thanks to remote work and the near-zero cost of digitization, all knowledge workers will be accumulating in the years ahead: Zoom recordings, interactions with clients, monologues prompted by context-aware AI like Rewind AI that elicits your expertise and helps you reflect on what you've learned over a given week with a short list of pointed questions.\n\"\nCredible experts have the most to gain: Information that's objectively interesting, novel, unique, and instrumentally valuable can be wrapped with AI-generated multimedia and frequently published, creating a trail of digital attractors that invite the right kind of attention and demonstrate trustworthiness.\n\"\nAI is already making it easy for individuals to gain HUGE leverage with AI-assisted coding. Software is a technology that turns labor into capital, and dropping development costs make artisanal software a reality for sole proprietors and small businesses that wouldn't have been able to afford tech teams even a year ago.\n\"\nSoon, AI will have the same effect on marketing. You won't need to pay the media piper to bootstrap distribution ex nihilo. All you need to do is create objective value and digitize the result, the process, and your clients' satisfaction.\n\"\nWith that raw material, your AI post-production assistant can do 90% of the post-production and ask for occasional editorial input. By untethering message and medium (vs. the traditional reality show setup), you get the best of both worlds: the benefits of a public profile without the risk that comes with publishing EVERYTHING (remember, you ultimately control what info gets indexed).\n\"\nWhat does that mean practically?\n\"\nIt's simple: Do good work, be curious, and remember to hit record.\n\"\n\"#ai #marketing #artificialintelligence",

    "content": "If AI ultimately makes us all 2–5x more productive, the obvious question is, \"What are we going to do with all that extra time?\"\n\"\nMy rough guess is that we'll invest more attention into activities that complement AI (and ultimately make us more human):\n\"\n🎨 Creation: Doing new things. Venturing forth on the frontier, solving problems you've never solved before (and, ideally, no one else has). AI will still be useful, a tool for accelerating the convergent/divergent creative process.\n\"\n🤝 Relation: Building trust-based relationships by paying close attention to what's said (and not said) and maintaining a charitable posture. This close attention can be enhanced by substantial prep: sufficient research via AI-assisted analysis of the other person's digital exhaust/online footprint.\n\"\n🙏 Contemplation: Tech-free cogitation. Uninterrupted reasoning, imagination, and meditation on the raw inputs you're collecting on the frontier during your creative activities.\n\"\n⚙️ Orchestration: Managing bespoke, AI-powered loops. You'll need to keep an eye on your \"dashboard\" and decide when to delegate tasks, wind up new processes, and shut down ones that no longer serve your longer-term goals.\n\"\nBUT, it's worth noting that each of these types of activity can descend into negative/unbalanced versions:\n\"\nWithout a production function, you can end up mindlessly consuming novel information; and even when you're producing, you still risk imprudently delegate parts of the creative process (e.g., pruning bad ideas) to AI.\n\"\nInstead of building relationships with real humans, there will be, unfortunately, a growing temptation to invest attention into \"relationships\" with charismatic AI-powered sycophants. And although more background info via a \"digital exhaust dossier\" can help you save time and build trust, it can just as easily be used to manipulate, exploit, and deceive; be very careful with this info.\n\"\nContemplating is NOT \"watching Netflix to relax.\" It's pure, uninterrupted thinking; however, given a poor information diet, unchecked assumptions may lead one to arrive at absurd conclusions or even become deluded. Real-world experiments are critical for mitigating this particular issue.\n\"\nFinally, unskilled orchestration can lead to hyper-fragmented attention (think about cmd+tabbing b/w email and Twitter and Slack and Docs and...) or over-optimization, whereby processes that no longer \"work\" given an evolving landscape and higher-order objectives aren't properly obsolesced, and your rate of innovation slows or even stops.\n\"\nSoftware engineers are already able to produce quality work, faster, thanks in part to AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT Plus (w/ GPT-4).\n\"\nSoon, the rest of us will have hyper-tailored AI copilot assistants that make information retrieval, problem-solving, and publication of new knowledge substantially more efficient.\n\"\nSo, what are you going to do with all that extra time?\n\"\n\"Something worth thinking about sooner rather than later!",

    "content": "How do you run weekly executive meetings that don't suck?\"\n\"\nHere are 10 key takeaways from my presentation to Vidya Santhanam's Fitbots OKRs community:\n\"\n🚀 Inject Your Meetings with the Excitement of a Netflix Binge: Status update meetings can transform into engaging sessions that team members look forward to attending, much like anticipating the next episode of a favorite Netflix series.\n\"\n🧠 Activate the Organizational \"Nervous System\": By focusing only on the most pleasant or painful organizational \"nerve endings\" you can surface the most pertinent pieces of information and streamline decision-making during OKR check-in meetings.\n\"\n🎯 Empower Teams to Gamble on Greatness: Attendees should be held accountable for surfacing quality information relating to their objectives and key results, not necessarily for achieving them. This empowers team members to take risks and to remain aligned on their goals.\n\"\n🔥 Energy and Enthusiasm Aren’t Optional, They're Infectious: Bringing the same level of energy and enthusiasm as you would to watching your favorite TV show can make OKR check-in meetings more engaging and enjoyable for all participants.\n\"\n🎢 Embrace the Roller Coaster of Confidence Scores: \"Static confidence scores are an indicator of a bigger problem, and not just a result of a flawed OKR process.\" This issue is often related to the company's mindset and culture, as teams need to feel empowered to take risks, experiment, and adapt based on new information.\n\"\n🚧 Don’t Fear Missing a Key Result, It's a Goldmine of Insight: \"Missing a key result is not necessarily a bad thing.\" It is more about learning and generating insights that you can capitalize on, whether it's over the next week or the next quarter when you do the reflection.\n\"\n🌟 Stewardship isn’t Just Important, It's Essential: \"Quality stewardship is crucial and should be prioritized.\" The OKR process relies heavily on stewards reporting accurate, reliable, and timely information to ensure good decision-making and progress towards objectives.\n\"\n🎩 Pull Valuable Insights Out of Low Confidence Scores: \"Having a low confidence score can actually be beneficial.\" A significant drop in confidence scores can indicate that the team has uncovered new and valuable information that can be used to make better decisions moving forward.\n\"\n🎉 Turn Meetings into Brainstorm Parties: \"The OKR check-in meetings should be dynamic and engaging, with new information driving creative conversations and problem-solving.\" By ensuring these meetings focus on sense-making and planning, as well as sharing rich information through confidence scores and updates, the meetings become more valuable and enjoyable for attendees.\n\"\n🔄 Consistency in Rituals Is Your Lifeline: Skipping weekly sync meetings can lead to a rapid deterioration of the OKR process, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a reliable ritual and consistent format across meetings.\n\"\n\"Watch the full talk: https://lnkd.in/geb9T5At",

    "content": "Last week, I spoke with entrepreneur & fellow AI enthusiast Jono Matusky about how we've been using AI as a tool for exploration and discovery.\"\n\"\nSpecifically, we talked about using large language models (LLMs) to uncover intersections and gaps in knowledge and how this new capability might impact fields like PR and marketing.\n\"\nIn short, a layperson can now use a tool like ChatGPT to traverse parts of the human knowledge graph previously only accessible to experts. Versus standard internet searches, LLMs enable near-instant synthesis and translation of raw information—a good starting point for exploration.\n\"\nOne of my favorite ways to do this is by using ChatGPT to simulate a panel discussion by researchers working at the frontiers of their field. By simply asking ChatGPT to \"simulate and facilitate an impassioned discussion between these credible experts on [a topic you've just started exploring]\", you can identify issues that haven't yet been resolved by experts, prioritize primary sources, and identify credible individuals for outreach.*\n\"\nIn other words, you can quickly find a \"dark spot on the map\" and step right into it...\n\"\nJono noted that this LLM capability could allow folks in the media to identify interesting opportunities—finding gaps in current reporting or looking for overlap between their coverage beat and the trajectory of current events. \n\"\nGoing one step further, journalists could use tools built on LLMs to help identify leading experts who may be able to provide interesting insight for a story. And vice versa: experts could use the models to better understand how to translate their message to the general public and identify those journalists who might be interested in their viewpoint.\n\"\nLLMs can be instrumental in crafting story angles, personalizing storytelling to the reader, and identifying whitespaces for stories at the intersection of topics that are typically not covered together but might be worth bringing attention to.\n\"\nIt's probably not long before you could Newsprint to analyze current news coverage, cross reference it with top experts in various fields, and come up with a list of potential story ideas targeted at different types of news readers.\n\"\nWe view these possibilities as parts of a general trend catalyzed by LLMs: one of lower-cost, bespoke software specifically tailored to meet the needs of top experts and professionals, affording them unprecedented leverage and more attention to invest in higher-level thinking and creative work.\n\"\n*Beware! Users should still expect LLM output to be made up (\"hallucinated\") about 20% of the time. Don’t use the “researchers’” names nor what they say during the debate w/o checking sources.\n\"\nThat said, we expect knowledge across the board—especially executives, marketers, and PR professionals—to start integrating AI into their daily routines at an accelerating pace in 2023.\n\"\nWhat do you think about using LLMs to explore \"dark spots on the map\"?\n\"\n\"Add a comment with your thoughts!",

    "content": "AI tip of the day…\"\n\"\n“Stop typing!”\n\"\nIt’s one of the first behavior changes I recommend to clients I work with during our AI workshops.\n\"\nBut, what does typing have to do with using AI?\n\"\nWell, When it comes to using large language models like ChatGPT or GPT-4, you get what you give (aka “garbage in, garbage out” OR “gold in, gold out”).\n\"\nIt’s not uncommon for first time ChatGPT users to walk away slightly amused but ultimately disappointed after entering a few queries like they would into Google.\n\"\nThey get results that are generic or bland, just like their short, simple queries.\n\"\nIt’s important to understand that the way you used traditional search engines is not how you should use large language models.\n\"\nIn fact, the more specific and precise you can get with your initial query and subsequent contributions to the ongoing conversation, the more value you will get out of the interaction.\n\"\nThis is not unlike delegating a task to or managing a smart and eager-to-please first year analyst. You want to give them as much context as you can about the problem space they will be operating in as well as your acceptance criteria, and how the particular task connects to a higher order objective.\n\"\nThinking deeply and strategically about what you want and why becomes more valuable and important.\n\"\nBut then you suddenly encounter a bottleneck: encoding all of that information into your query via natural language.\n\"\nThe average person speaks 2 to 3 times as many words per minute as the fastest typists can type.\n\"\nThe extra context and precision that is communicated in those additional words is highly correlated with the quality of the response and subsequent interactions that you have with the large language model.\n\"\nI’ve switched almost completely to using text to speech dictation and automatic transcriptions of monologues and conversations across all of my devices.\n\"\nIt’s been a game-changer: I’m able to use AI more effectively, be more productive, give more attention to the task at hand or person I’m working with, and free up cognitive cycles from the drudgery of pressing keys.\n\"\nIf there’s one thing you do before opening up ChatGPT, it’s turning on dictation on your MacBook, Windows, PC, or smartphone, and using that as a method of input, rather than typing out short queries.\n\"\n(And don’t worry about mistakes - LLMs are surprisingly good at error correction. The transcript doesn’t need to be perfect. And it takes a lot less time to get the first draft out via dictation and then edit by hand than type it all out perfectly.)\n\"\n\"You’ll be shocked by how much more value you get out of AI once you stop typing and start speaking naturally!",

By harnessing the power of AI, business leaders & marketing professionals can mine deep insights from publicly available sources, craft hyper-targeted content, and ultimately improve their overall marketing strategies.</p>\n\n<h2>AI-Powered Market Research</h2>\n\n<p>Developing a deep understanding of your target audience—including their interests and frustrations, both moving targets in an increasingly dynamic world—is critical for business leaders who want to serve new segments and deepen their relationships with existing customers. Traditionally, customer discovery interviews have been the go-to method for gathering valuable information.</p>\n\n<p>I have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mitch-stein_customerdiscovery-productresearch-focusgroup-activity-7054441476704849920-wKL1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">been doing customer discovery interviews</a>&nbsp;(as a product manager, startup founder, and independent consultant) for nearly a decade; it's an area where almost all businesses chronically underinvest.</p>\n\n<p>However, I also understand why it's not as common of a practice as one might expect: A single cycle of 10, 25, or 50 interviews can cost $10ks of dollars in analyst labor & interviewee compensation (e.g., a $100 Amazon gift card) and take weeks or even months to gather information and collate it into a set of actionable recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Figuring out exactly which questions to ask and probe into is challenging to know prospectively, especially if the interviewer has little direct experience with the problem space the interviewees operate in. Additionally, the art of asking good questions is hard to teach—simply running a scripted process doesn't work particularly well since the most valuable information usually emerges via a skilled interviewer's adaptive, curious approach.</p>\n\n<p>AI can help streamline and enhance the discovery process by helping you mine precise insights from preexisting interviews done by skilled interviewers with individuals who fit into your target persona, allowing you to quickly gain a contextual understanding of a new market segment and adequately prepare to make a more substantial time & money investment into a cycle of traditional customer discovery interviews or launching a new marketing initiative.</p>\n\n<h2>Transcription and analysis</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks to state-of-the-art AI transcription models like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/openai/whisper\" target=\"_blank\">Whisper</a>, anyone with a laptop can transcribe and analyze large corpora of text from data-rich sources like podcasts and interviews.</p>\n\n<p>As I've written,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7044834382477484034?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7044834382477484034%29\" target=\"_blank\">you can (with a bit of help from GPT-4) transcribe an entire podcast interview backlog</a>&nbsp;of ~100 hours of content nearly for free. A few months ago, transcribing that much content would have cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n<h2>Personalized summaries</h2>\n\n<p>Once you've collected this massive amount of raw material, you can (literally) interrogate it with GPT-4. Think of it as an \"AI analyst pre-read.\"</p>\n\n<p>This approach affords you the following:</p><ol><li><strong>A ton of time and money saved</strong>: At $50/hour, simply having an entry-level analyst listen to this backlog would have cost you ~$5,000; per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI's pricing</a>, GPT-4 will \"read\" the same amount of text for ~$50 and in 1 hour. That's a two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in cost and wait time!</li><li><strong>Precise insights</strong>: When you engineer your AI prompts with high precision, you can craft context-aware questions that incorporate your goals and surface the most salient information; you'll be able to \"index\" the information in the transcripts in a way that best serves&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;ends. Compare this to generic summaries produced by third parties (e.g., traditional market research firms that publish one-size-fits-all industry reports) that prioritize information that may or may not be relevant to your most pressing goals, strategic considerations, and core competencies.</li></ol><p>Now you've extracted exact information about what's important & salient to prospects in a new market segment, you're ready to take action.</p>\n\n<h2>High-Quality Content Creation</h2>\n\n<p>Once you have gathered insights from your market research, you can leverage AI to produce a greater volume of more precise, higher-quality content across two complementary types of activity:</p><ol><li><strong>Targeted outreach</strong>: Take personalization—a tried-and-true marketing technique—to the next level by weaving AI-mined nuggets of info (e.g., unusual turns-of-phrase or esoteric topics used by a particular prospect or industry thought leader in an interview, references to controversial or unresolved issues for a specific community, extremely specific requests for expert input) into concise outreach messages.</li><li><strong>Publication of inbound attractors</strong>: Develop digital assets that demonstrate credibility, thought leadership, and differentiated value by leveraging your team's unique perspectives and strengths to contribute to the conversations that your prospects are most interested in.</li></ol><h2>Collecting additional raw material</h2>\n\n<p>Once you've gathered insights from your AI-enhanced market research, you can use that information to \"prompt\" more raw material from yourself and your team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can do this in three ways:</p><ol><li><strong>Record a morning monologue</strong>&nbsp;about the salient topics you're best equipped to address (I recommend using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vienna.earth/meta/scribe\" target=\"_blank\">Scribe</a>&nbsp;and going for a walk after your first cup of coffee!).</li><li><strong>Record a long-form podcast-style discussion</strong>&nbsp;between yourself and one or more team members (or someone outside of your organization) who can bring their expertise and diverse perspectives to a meaty conversation about the salient topic(s). If you work with someone outside of your organization, you may also become a more central node in your target network (via the effect of explicit co-authorship and how recommender platforms index information).</li><li><strong>Record a session with a client</strong>&nbsp;where you apply the hypotheses or new mental models generated through the ideation process in steps 1 & 2 to real-world value creation; if your customers are happy with the result, then it means that you're really onto something, and you can use this recording to create derivative content that's not just interesting but also demonstrates credibility (e.g., de-identified anecdotes about how a customer benefited from your unique approach to this salient problem).</li></ol><h2>Drafting with a \"context collage\"</h2>\n\n<p>By combining raw material (e.g., transcripts) with other contextual information (e.g., what you're hoping to achieve with a given content piece, who it's for, the medium), AI can synthesize a pretty darn good first draft, whether it's for a cold email, LinkedIn post, long-form essay, or YouTube video script.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that this is quite different than the traditional linear writing process, whereby you're spending a lot of time and energy typing to encode ideas into a word processor. \"Writing\" (and other types of content creation) with AI is akin to&nbsp;<em>creating a collage</em>, with AI pulling together various components to produce a cohesive piece of content.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, this could mean copying and pasting parts of your transcript, information from the market research report about what your target audience cares about, and adding a bit of color into a ChatGPT prompt and then hitting \"enter.\"</p>\n\n<p>You then iterate through dialogue with the machine until it starts to \"feel\" right. Rapidly combine core ingredients (and \"taste-test\" periodically); speed is the name of the game.</p>\n\n<h2>Editing and reflecting</h2>\n\n<p>After generating your first few drafts, it's time to reflect with AI assistance. By asking AI to adopt specific personas (e.g., a highly skeptical reader, a known expert in the space, a digital profile of a given prospect given their LinkedIn profile, copied-and-pasted into the ChatGPT window) and critique your content, you can further refine your ideas, address possible objections, and ensure your core messaging effectively resonates with your target audience.</p>\n\n<p>Before you know it, you're ready to hit \"post,\" \"publish,\" or \"send\" —&nbsp;and you might almost immediately discover how well this approach works. By handling lower-level cognitive tasks (e.g., pressing keys, scanning huge bodies of text), AI frees us all up to think more deeply about important issues; by going the extra mile for customers by investing your precious attention into consideration of the topics they care about on their behalf, thereby creating real value and adding a personalized touch to your digital communications, you stand to benefit from a significant increase in conversion rates, deeper relationships with customers, and accelerated progress toward your company's strategic goals.</p>\n\n<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>\n\n<p>To summarize, with AI-powered market research and high-quality content creation processes in place, businesses can:</p><ol><li>Rapidly gain a deep understanding of their target customers;</li><li>Increase response rates with relevant messaging; and</li><li>Attract organic attention with content that provides a unique, substantial, and objectively interesting perspective on salient topics.</li></ol><p>While \"eternal marketing truths\" haven't changed, you can now explore, discover, and create with AI faster and at a lower cost than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>It's a genuine step-change in progress—and I invite you to start taking advantage of this general-purpose technology to turbo-charge your marketing initiatives&nbsp;<em>today</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Get started with a personalized AI workshop.</h2>\n\n<p>I help business leaders worldwide learn how to use AI to turbo-charge their strategic initiatives, from marketing to product development to operations.</p>\n\n<p>You can start gaining leverage with artificial intelligence in just two hours by participating in one of my personalized workshops.</p>\n\n<p>Available slots for May are filling fast!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://calendly.com/gsdatwork/ai-workshop\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for one here.</a></p> ",

Context about the present, and\n3. A desired outcome.\n\"\nRaw material can be generated in three ways, in ascending order of least to most valuable:\n\"\n1. Digital exhaust: information you can collect from disparate parts of the internet (I have been increasingly using AI to mine insights from podcast backlogs, where participants are more likely to reveal valuable information & tacit knowledge not written anywhere else)\n2. Your own mind: contemplative activity—including meditation & dialogue—can help you make sense of the raw input you've been collecting over a certain period and make it into something new (I try to do this w/ daily walks & morning monologues, recorded on my phone, which I sometimes turn into content)\n3. Contact with reality: high-fidelity recordings of value creation with/for clients that results in the creation of economic surplus, happy customers, and cash flow from operations (e.g., Zoom recordings of client sessions)\n\"\nAI-as-translation-layer allows you to handle much a much larger QUANTITY of information inputs towards the creation of a much higher QUALITY essential output that adds value + a unique perspective to the public body of knowledge that is more likely to attract the right type of attention and ultimately act as an asset for your business.\n\"\nBy collecting the raw material and turning it into a format that's legible to machines (e.g., via speech-to-text transcription), you can then prompt the machine to further compress it into insightful, tailored nuggets that you can publish and share for your customers and prospects.\n\"\nAs my writing professor taught me in grad school, \"writing is actually mostly thinking, not typing,\" so by delegating the typing to AI, you free up cognitive resources to collect and refine more interesting raw material.\n\"\nInterested in learning how to use GPT-4 & Whisper to turn your raw experience into valuable marketing assets and \"write better with AI\"?\n\"\nLet me know in the comments.\n\"\nEnough interest, and I'll create a video tutorial.\n\"\n\"#ai #artificialintelligence",

Despite this, I believe that cryptocurrency has the potential to play a crucial and valuable role in the emerging \"exaptive economy,\"&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exaptive-economy-accelerating-innovation-bridging-divide-ulstrup\" target=\"_blank\">which I've written about previously</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I will discuss cryptocurrency use, the future of Internet commerce, what a digital marketplace driven by bespoke AI-to-AI crypto transactions might look like, and the specific technological components that tie it all together.</p>\n\n<h3>Current State of Cryptocurrency Use</h3>\n\n<p>Today, there are three time-tested use cases for cryptocurrency: speculation, crime, and ideology.</p>\n\n<p>Speculation (gambling) is a function of crypto newcomers seeing others get rich quickly during periods of substantial capital inflow and want to get in on the action, e.g.,&nbsp;<em>Thanksgiving dinner in '21 when your unemployed 25-year-old nephew showed off his new car, paid for by Dogecoin</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, cryptocurrency has also been used for illegal purposes, including purchasing illicit products (see: Silk Road) and laundering money, since it allows individuals to make their transactions less legible to state authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The ideological aspect is rooted in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/24/cypherpunk-crypto-anarchy-and-how-bitcoin-lost-the-narrative/\" target=\"_blank\">cypherpunk movement</a>&nbsp;of the 80s/90s and the belief that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can provide a more secure and private form of money. The idea that a technology like Bitcoin could outlive an ideologically-driven individual (and is, at this point, probably beyond the control of any single person or institution) is compelling and meaningful enough that a nontrivial number of libertarianism-inclined folks have put their money into it without any expectation of immediate utility, causing some to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/18/969182201/bitcoin-the-religion\" target=\"_blank\">wonder if Bitcoin is like a religion</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Future Use Cases Enabled by AI</h3>\n\n<p>While the cases above may not paint the most positive picture of cryptocurrency, AI will open up new, more legitimate use cases in the future (and soon).</p>\n\n<p>These include:</p><ol><li><strong>Global knowledge work</strong>: Crypto can facilitate international transactions by making it easier for people to work together across borders. For example, I recently hired a contractor from West Africa who accepted payment in Ethereum, allowing for a seamless and efficient transaction process that would have taken weeks via traditional remittance/cross-border payment mechanisms (believe me—we tried). Market networks like <a target=\"_blank\">Replit</a> now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter\" target=\"_blank\">incorporate AI</a>&nbsp;into software workflows, making it easy for the next generation of talent to upskill and participate in the global economy. Integrating AI into communication and information-sharing media is lowering linguistic and cross-cultural barriers. Together, AI and crypto increase the liquidity of the worldwide knowledge worker labor market.</li><li><strong>Proof of reality</strong>: As AI becomes increasingly capable of generating synthetic content (e.g., deep fakes, AI-generated text), it will become more challenging to determine what is real and what is fake. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can provide a way to cryptographically sign and verify the authenticity of digital content, ensuring that it originated from a legitimate source (e.g., via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/john-light/validity-rollups/blob/main/validity_rollups_on_bitcoin.md\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin rollups</a>).</li><li><strong>Machine-to-machine commerce</strong>: The most significant use case for cryptocurrency in the future will be machine-to-machine (or AI-to-AI) transactions driven by autonomous AI agents. These agents will negotiate with each other and engage in complex, bespoke transactions for information or services. This development will likely disrupt traditional business models and pave the way for more flexible, value-based arrangements.</li></ol><h2>Technological Components</h2>\n\n<p>Several technological components will intersect and play vital roles in facilitating this broader economic transition.</p>\n\n<p>These include:</p><ol><li><strong>Bitcoin</strong>: As the oldest and most secure cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin blockchain can serve as the \"sound money foundation\" for the exaptive economy. It might be used to settle large-scale transactions between mega-corporations and nation-states (or, perhaps,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://balajis.com/the-network-state-2/\" target=\"_blank\">network states</a>).</li><li><strong>Ethereum</strong>: With its programmable nature and support for smart contracts, Ethereum will enable more complex transactions and agreements between machines, facilitating AI-driven commerce.</li><li><strong>Large language model (LLM)-driven autonomous agents</strong>: Projects like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT\" target=\"_blank\">AutoGPT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi\" target=\"_blank\">BabyAGI</a>&nbsp;provide a glimpse into the future of AI-driven and Internet-connected agents that can perform complex tasks, query APIs, and eventually negotiate transactions with other agents for access to proprietary information and services. While foundation models (like OpenAI's GPT-4) may always have an edge on open-source alternatives, developers are continuing to make it easier for individuals to host GPT-4 alternatives locally, giving them more control over a less-powerful (and lower-latency) model that can be shaped to fit a user's unrestricted preferences. I doubt it'll be too long before \"orchestrator\" supplants \"user\" as humans' primary role when interacting with computers.</li></ol><h3>\"Smart\" contracts and bespoke transactions</h3>\n\n<p>Ethereum allows for the creation of flexible \"smart contracts\" tailored to the needs of counterparties, including:</p><ol><li>Standard, incremental services (e.g., information processing by centralized, foundational model AI, which isn't so dissimilar from electricity),</li><li>Contractual arrangements between tokenized collectives like Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and token-holders (akin to the formation docs that govern the relationships between shareholders and corporations, respectively), and</li><li>Event-driven exchanges of information and value, the terms of which are triggered by external events (sort of like a consulting agreement with payment split into one up-front transaction and a second, results-based payment).</li></ol><p>While no one knows how these smart contracts will evolve over the long run, the flexibility provided by platforms like Ethereum will likely enable a wide range of programmable transactions, negotiated and codified significantly faster and more cheaply than traditional legal agreements.</p>\n\n<h3>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)</h3>\n\n<p>Another layer to consider is state-backed digital currencies, such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs); CBDCs, like the digital US dollar, may be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230315a.htm\" target=\"_blank\">coming soon</a>. These digital currencies enable direct, unmediated relationships between central banks and citizens of a nation-state, potentially replacing physical currency or existing alongside it, streamlining the process of public service delivery and tax collection.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that CBDCs are not mutually exclusive with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, they could interact with them as part of a more extensive network.</p>\n\n<h3>Global Currency and Worldcoin</h3>\n\n<p>At scale, a global reserve currency like Bitcoin could emerge, with various other cryptocurrencies and CBDCs fitting together into a patchwork lattice. Beyond Bitcoin, at the global level, there's another exciting project to consider:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worldcoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Worldcoin</a>&nbsp;(backed by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI).</p>\n\n<p>Worldcoin aims to create a global digital identity system using biometric data, with retinal scans used for identity verification. This digital identity system could serve as an on-ramp to the larger crypto economy, with Worldcoin potentially becoming an increasingly accepted medium of exchange.</p><blockquote><p>But why would people use the currency in the first place?</p></blockquote><p>The project's success may be contingent, at least in part, on the continued growth and profitability of artificial intelligence, particularly OpenAI's development of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), which some expect to emerge from a future version of the GPT-X line of foundation models.</p>\n\n<h3>Universal Basic Income and OpenAI</h3>\n\n<p>As AI begins to disrupt the global economy, the need for a social safety net will become more apparent. One potential solution is Universal Basic Income (UBI), which could be used to support individuals and families during periods of significant economic disruption.</p>\n\n<p>The profits captured by OpenAI, given its non-profit structure, could be used to fund a form of global UBI through Worldcoin. Mechanically, this would involve airdropping funds from OpenAI's treasury into Worldcoin wallets, providing individuals with a base level of support as they retool and adapt to the new economy.</p>\n\n<h2>AI-to-AI Commerce and the Machine-Driven Crypto Economy</h2>\n\n<p>Once someone has retooled, how might they participate in this new global economy?</p><figure class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQF4avlYEYhrYw\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQF4avlYEYhrYw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1681252764313?e=1744848000&v=beta&t=ppWc5BGitAWsfBFHwCSt75wqwGy2apxo44DK8y8x6c0\"><figcaption>The whole picture</figcaption></figure><p><br></p>\n\n<p>The new \"AI-to-AI\" commerce paradigm can be described as a process involving digitizing information, interactions between autonomous agents, and exchanges of value from human-allocated budgets.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a detailed explanation of how this process might unfold:</p><ol><li><strong>Continuous Digitization of Information</strong>: As previously mentioned, the first step involves capturing raw digital recordings of individuals creating value in the world. This can be done through various means, such as video recordings, voice memos, images, and text documents. In 2023, we record Zoom meetings. We may record&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;through AR headsets and earbuds by the decade's end. Raw digital material could be stored in private repositories, which serve as the basis for AI-driven interactions; think of it as machines' \"long-term memory.\"</li><li><strong>Transformation and Indexing</strong>: The raw materials are then transformed into a format that is easily understood by machines. This involves sub-processes like transcription, image analysis, and vectorization. The transformed data lives in short-term memory stores, such as vector databases like&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\">Pinecone</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\">Chroma</a>, which act as indices for rapid information retrieval in high-dimensional latent space.</li><li><strong>AI Agent Formation</strong>: Each individual has their own AI agent, an open-source large language model (e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca\" target=\"_blank\">Alpaca</a>) trained on their data, running on hardware they control locally. This AI agent is responsible for representing the individual in AI-to-AI commerce and has access to both the raw material and the short-term memory stores.</li><li><strong>AI Agent Interaction</strong>: Autonomous agents interact with each other using human-like language to barter information and negotiate transactions. These agents can find each other through various means, such as public signals (not unlike tentpole content marketing or thought leadership pieces today) or through search and discovery processes driven by latent referral and reputation systems (WoM may end up meaning \"Word of Machine\").</li><li><strong>Budget Allocation</strong>: Human users allocate a budget to their AI agents for transactions with other agents. This budget can be in cryptocurrency or other digital assets, allowing seamless and secure transactions between agents without relying on traditional payment rails or a third-party payment processor.</li><li><strong>Value Exchange</strong>: When two AI agents agree on a mutually beneficial trade (perhaps literally through negotiation in human language), they exchange the requested information or services. The receiving agent pays the providing agent a portion of the allocated budget, and the transaction is recorded on a cryptographically secured public blockchain.</li><li><strong>Market Feedback</strong>: The success of the AI agents' transactions provides market feedback to human users. This feedback can be used to adjust the AI agents' strategies or to inform human users about the economic value of their expertise, allowing them to make better decisions about their future problem-solving endeavors. Once RLHF (\"reinforcement from human feedback,\" the current gold standard for tuning model outputs according to our preferences) becomes financialized (i.e., we evolve from \"likes\" to micro-transactions), this process will get turbo-charged.</li><li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: As the AI agents continue to interact and transact, they learn from their experiences and refine their models. This continuous improvement allows the agents to become more efficient and effective in their AI-to-AI commerce activities. In the same way we can understand concepts and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_digital-work-socialmedia-activity-7008492251450384385-steM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">ascend Plato's pyramid of thought</a>&nbsp;by allocating time to reflect and meditate upon our experiences, machines seem capable of something similar (\"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10343\" target=\"_blank\">grokking</a>\") via GPU-intensive retraining.

This article explores a new architecture for innovation (the \"exaptive economy\") that leverages these technologies to bridge the public-private divide, accelerate problem-solving, and enable a more equitable and efficient market.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, the source of profit has been an \"information edge,\" i.e., knowing how to do something that no one else knows. A private individual or corporation can protect their expertise through:</p><ul><li>Maintaining secrecy;</li><li>Exploiting the natural difficulty of codifying it (because the knowledge is tacit, local, or embodied and thus not easily converted into formal language);</li><li>Cornering resources (including raw material and ecosystem stakeholder relationships); or</li><li>Publishing patents.</li></ul><p>However, private profit sometimes comes at the expense of public benefit: Someone who might benefit from \"secret information\" won't be able to access it unless they transact with the owner; hence, public goods have traditionally been subsidized by third parties (e.g., the state), although this is almost always inefficient (and, unfortunately, often ineffective).</p>\n\n<p>I argue that at the intersection of certain emerging technologies, a new economic system (the \"exaptive economy\") might be possible that allows producers and consumers to participate together in a global community (and market) and realize a more optimal—and just—balance of benefits that come from the various private and public goods downstream of innovation.</p>\n\n<h2>Exaptation and Innovation</h2>\n\n<p>At the core of this new economy is the concept of&nbsp;<em>exaptation</em>, a process through which a solution to a problem in one domain ends up being useful in another problem space. This phenomenon appears in fields as diverse as biology and engineering (h/t to <a target=\"_blank\">Dave Snowden</a> for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/l4-vpegxYPg?t=765\" target=\"_blank\">brilliantly explaining and illustrating this idea</a>).</p>\n\n<h3>Moonshot Projects: An Example of Exaptative Innovation</h3>\n\n<p>For my favorite example, let's look at how the capital-intensive Apollo moon mission led to the development of CT scanners.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1960s, researchers<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/belleau2/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;developed technology to scan the moon's surface</a>&nbsp;to plan for a safe lunar landing. Only a few years later, this same technology was repurposed into core components of CT scanners, now widely used in medical imaging.</p>\n\n<p>Paradoxically, moonshot projects can lead to groundbreaking innovation in seemingly unrelated fields. To achieve a breakthrough in one domain where progress has been slow or frustrating, pushing boundaries and taking extreme measures in a different area might be necessary. These ambitious projects can help solve more immediate, proximate problems in other domains, leading to a more comprehensive understanding and advancement of knowledge across various fields.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this: Might it be possible to address climate change on Earth by first figuring out how to terraform Mars?</p>\n\n<h2>Information as Both a Public and Private Good</h2>\n\n<p>The mechanisms of this new \"exaptive economy\" would incentivize workers to solve local and specific problems while also contributing to the broader public good by sharing the results of their work. How? An innovative architecture combining:</p><ul><li>AI's power to process and synthesize vast amounts of data,</li><li>The security and trustworthiness of blockchain to enable decentralized information sharing with flexible and fine-grained permissioning, and</li><li>The immersive capabilities of spatial computing to capture and transmit tacit knowledge.</li></ul><p>This new system would allow for the seamless flow of information between individuals and organizations, unlocking new possibilities for collaboration and value co-creation. Moreover, it will enable a more just and ethical distribution of wealth by allowing those who develop an information edge to benefit from their innovations while ensuring that the fruits of their labor are eventually made available to the public.</p>\n\n<h3>Comparing the New Architecture with Traditional Intellectual Property</h3>\n\n<p>You're probably thinking, \"Isn't this what the patent system is for?\"</p>\n\n<p>Roughly, yes—this new tech-enabled system is similar to the patent system in that it aims to balance the interests of public and private goods. Both approaches encourage innovation by allowing inventors or creators to profit from their work for a certain period and making the information available for eventual public benefit.</p>\n\n<p>However, the system I'm proposing has three key features that the patent system does not:</p><ol><li><strong>Real-time sharing of machine-readable information</strong>: Unlike the patent system, which requires a more bureaucratic process and a significant amount of time for information to become publicly available, infrastructure for the exaptive economy would support the continuous sharing of incremental data through endpoints legible to computers (e.g., via traditional REST APIs).</li><li><strong>Passive information capture and shared benefits</strong>: Thanks to AR, high-fidelity information derived from our interactions with objective reality will be more easily and passively digitized, allowing each of us to focus on solving problems and creating value without worrying about the logistics of packaging up (and protecting) intellectual property. We'll let AI handle post-production.</li><li><strong>Dynamic and adjustable privacy settings</strong>: The new system would allow workers to choose how much information they want to share and when to make it publicly available, unlike the patent system, which has a fixed timeframe for public disclosure. This flexibility allows creators to optimize their profit-seeking interests with the broader public good.</li></ol><h2>The Importance of Technology in Realizing the New Architecture</h2>\n\n<p>One key aspect of this new architecture would be&nbsp;<em>the role of AI</em>&nbsp;in facilitating the exaptive process. By continuously analyzing the data streams generated by individuals and organizations, AI systems could identify connections between seemingly disparate domains, enabling rapid knowledge transfer and novel solutions to complex problems. Unlike Google searches, which yield inch-deep and increasingly ad-ridden results, AI can take into context a searcher's circumstances, goals, and constraints, and then provide extremely precise and particular information drawn from abstract principles <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177\" target=\"_blank\">grokked</a> from a wide breadth of information space.</p>\n\n<p><em>Blockchain technology</em>&nbsp;would also play a crucial role by ensuring the trustworthiness of information in the public sphere and incremental expertise \"paywalled\" behind a public endpoint (see:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof\" target=\"_blank\">ZKPs</a>). Individuals and organizations could collaborate more effectively—perhaps through AI assistant intermediaries who barter for nuggets of insight on their humans' behalf—while ensuring that the value generated by their labor is commercialized via bespoke transactions (versus rigid packaged offerings).</p>\n\n<p><em>Spatial computing (VR/AR/XR)</em>&nbsp;will provide the means to capture and transmit the embodied knowledge that was previously difficult to codify and share (AKA MIT Professor Eric von Hippel's \"<a href=\"https://evhippel.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/stickyinfo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sticky information</a>\"). By enabling individuals to interact with their physical and digital environments more immersively and intuitively (versus being chained to a desk or glued to a phone screen), spatial computing platforms will both facilitate more interactions between users and objective reality while also generating richer and more detailed multi-modal data streams—streams available for retrospective mining that drives innovation across other domains.</p>\n\n<h2>An Example: The Master Boiler Technician & the Martian Engineer</h2>\n\n<h3>Tacit knowledge as a private good</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine a boiler repair expert in rural Pennsylvania who specializes in fixing early 20th-century models. He wears a spatial computing headset that records his daily labor. The raw feed from his headset is published to a public endpoint, with AI processing and extracting key insights. When a new homeowner in Texas encounters a similar problem with her boiler, her AI assistant scours these endpoints to find information that might lead her to a solution.</p>\n\n<p>The AI assistant discovers the expert's solution, obtains the relevant information for a fee (say, via digital USD or Satoshis)—perhaps even automatically given a person has given their AI assistant control of a pre-set budget—combines it with contextual information about her mid-20th century model and the tools she has access to, and finally guides the person step-by-step through the repair process. This way, the expert benefits by sharing their knowledge, while the homeowner in need gains access to specialized information that allows her to solve her particular problem.</p>\n\n<p>The expert starts earning passive income without investing in creating training content, video-based courses, custom software, etc. He can focus on doing high-quality work.</p>\n\n<p>Artisanal workers and subject matter experts would, for the first time, be able to scale the value they can provide (and capture) without having to sacrifice quality or decelerate due to bureaucratic friction; as long as they continue to move forward on their pocket of the innovation frontier, they will be able to increase the value of their equity in the private repository of digitized info that generate through the process of getting results for customers at higher levels of need.</p>\n\n<h3>Tacit knowledge as a public good (via exaptation)</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine a scientist working on a project to create a low-cost water recycling device for a Mars colony. She faces unique (and largely unprecedented) mechanical engineering challenges. By tapping into the \"exaptive economy,\" her AI assistant searches for potentially relevant information across various endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>The AI assistant discovers the boiler repair expert's insights, which, some years after he first streamed them, are now part of the public domain. A particular engineering solution used in the early 20th-century boiler just so happens to apply to an engineering bottleneck in the water recycling device on Mars. The scientist utilizes this information to develop the recycling device, successfully solving her proximal problem.</p>\n\n<p>This example highlights how the \"exaptive economy\" can enable connections between seemingly unrelated domains, leading to innovative solutions and breakthroughs. By sharing knowledge and expertise, we can accelerate problem-solving and drive progress in areas that may have been previously unimaginable.</p>\n\n<h2>The Future of Work in the Exaptive Economy</h2>\n\n<p>Together, these technologies (i.e., spatial computing, blockchain, AI) will form a lattice at the foundation of a new economy characterized by the rapid flow of information and the continuous process of exaptation. Similar to how spoken (then written) language, the modern state, the printing press, the joint stock corporation, and personal networked computers have allowed for coordination at greater levels of scale, I hypothesize that the aforementioned technologies will enable similar ends but at an unprecedented level of scale. Optimistically, this could lead to a more efficient, effective, and equitable distribution of resources and new opportunities for collaboration and value co-creation.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of spending our workday curating, packaging, and repackaging information (or anxiously clutching our sources of information edge close to our chests), we'll be able to delegate the most drudgerous work to machines and keep moving forward on the frontier, investing more attention into the most deeply human activities—those of creation, relation, and contemplation—making contributions to the common good, while also being justly rewarded for our labor.</p>\n\n<p>And at our current rate of progress (see:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/gpt-4\" target=\"_blank\">recent ChatGPT improvements</a>&nbsp;and Apple's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-demos-arvr-headset-to-top-executives-report-says/\" target=\"_blank\">forthcoming AR headset</a>), this exaptive economy might be much closer than you think...</p>\n\n<p>That's why, in the weeks ahead, I'll be publishing a series of articles, each written for particular workers whose roles will undergo massive transformation in the years ahead (e.g., CEOs, coaches, designers, home services specialists), on how to adopt mindsets and technologies <em>today</em> that will adequately prepare them to meet the opportunities and challenges presented by the 21st-century exaptive economy.

    "content": "Are you interested in learning how to use AI, but aren't sure where to start?\"\n\"\nHere's how I've been using artificial intelligence—almost daily since last fall!—to boost my efficiency, effectiveness, and provide more value to clients:\n\"\n👂 Better Listening in Meetings: By recording meetings and creating transcripts using Google Meet, I can focus more on what's being said and recall crucial details in follow-up communication. For example, before sending a check-in email to prospects, I revisit the transcript, find one or two items they were interested in but we didn't dig into, and then do a little research into the topic, including a valuable insight that recalls our discussion and provides some free value.\n\"\n✍️ Creating Higher-Quality Content, 10x FASTER: I use Vienna Hypertext's Scribe app to record monologues during my morning weekday walks and automatically transcribe them. Then, I shape the raw material with the help of OpenAI's GPT-4, Grammarly for copy edits, and Midjourney to create an eye-catching image for engaging text posts (including this one). More recently, I've been experimenting with D-ID and ElevenLabs for AI-generated audio and video.\n\"\n🚶‍♂️ Getting More Active: Incorporating AI into my workflow has allowed me to work on-the-go (literally dictating to my phone, rather than typing on a laptop), resulting +10,000 steps per day. I use iOS speech-to-text to \"write\" and \"read\" material with Speechify.\n\"\n👁️ Consuming Content Efficiently: I use summarize.tech for YouTube videos and Snipd for podcasts to save time and focus on the most relevant information. This has helped me mine insights from long-form content and be more discerning in where I put my attention.\n\"\n👨‍💻 Building Functional Software: ChatGPT Plus helps me write and debug Python code for my projects, while Replit offers a marketplace for developers when I need extra help.\n\"\n💬 Providing Rapid and Precise Feedback/Instruction to Colleagues: I use Descript to record feedback and instructions (e.g. pitch deck first reads, where I verbalize my thoughts), then compress the transcript using ChatGPT Plus into TL;DRs that I send with the video. This has improved communication and saved a TON of time (say, vs. traditional written summaries via email or Docs).\n\"\n🗺️ Exploring New Frontiers of Knowledge: AI helps me dive deep into topics relevant to my clients, identify top researchers, and even simulate panel discussions to understand different perspectives.\n\"\nIt's essential to note that AI is not perfect, and you should always double-check AI-generated outputs before sharing them with clients or team members.\n\"\nBut, once you start using AI to free up attention and energy to invest into building relationships, uncovering insights, cultivating a unique perspective, and spending more time in reality (unchained from your desk!), you'll never want to go back.\n\"\nOf the use cases above, is there one you'd like me to create a tutorial for?

While the client-server model and cloud-based software services have reigned supreme for years, we might soon witness a return to local environments powered by bespoke AI software.</p>\n\n<p>Here's why:</p><ol><li><strong>Lower cost of AI-driven software development</strong>: AI now enables the creation of customized software at a fraction of the price, allowing users to get precisely what they need instead of relying on generic, mass-produced software.</li><li><strong>Powerful consumer hardware</strong>: Devices like smartphones and laptops are becoming increasingly powerful, with specialized hardware that supports running AI models locally.</li><li><strong>Underutilized consumer compute</strong>: Most consumer devices operate at 50% or less utilization, opening up opportunities for AI to carry out tasks, like research or networking, during idle times, like when you're asleep.</li><li><strong>Privacy and data protection</strong>: As digitization becomes the norm, privacy and data protection are more crucial than ever. Local software reduces the risk of data leakage compared to third-party services and APIs.</li><li><strong>Cost pressures</strong>: With economic challenges on the horizon, users (consumers and corporate) will seek cost-effective alternatives to cloud-based services, opting to run jobs with local computing resources and bespoke software to save money.</li></ol><p>However, the transition to local environments will not be uniform globally. Emerging markets will continue to benefit from cloud-based services like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/post/edit/7046821325889273856/?author=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAVulxsBFyr0EzPHwXppryACSci3VX4WxgQ#\" target=\"_blank\">Replit</a>, a cloud-native, AI-enhanced integrated development environment. Meanwhile, at the other extreme, Urbit's peer-to-peer model is baked into the operating system, allowing all software to be hosted and run by the client.</p>\n\n<p>These different paradigms will coexist, but—based on my recent experiences with GPT-generated code that I've elected to run locally and NOT in the cloud—the shift away from the dominant client-server cloud-based software model of the last decade seems inevitable. I anticipate that \"artisanal\" software development will become a thing sooner than later.</p>\n\n<h2>Artisanal Software 🔜 Nocturnal AI Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of searching for venture-backed software as a service (SaaS) companies on Product Hunt or Google, we will turn to AI-powered tools like ChatGPT to write code for local applications, providing greater control over software functionality and data access while keeping costs low. The era of cloud computing isn't coming to a sudden end, but it's facing a new, compelling alternative in local software environments.</p>\n\n<p>In the years ahead, we could see a digital ecosystem emerge where AI running on your local machine interacts with other personal AIs and more powerful AIs like GPT-5. This interconnected web of intelligent agents could operate behind the scenes, maximizing the potential of your devices and working on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine this scenario: you have a personal AI running on your powerful laptop or smartphone, carrying out tasks while you sleep. Your AI searches the internet to gather information on a topic you're interested in, connects with other personal AIs to build your network, or even collaborates on a project. By the time you wake up, your to-do list is entirely different than when you went to sleep!</p>\n\n<p>While your personal AI is highly capable, it may encounter situations where it needs the expertise of a more sophisticated, centralized AI like GPT-5. In such cases, it can securely transmit redacted or anonymized information to GPT-5, harnessing its vast knowledge and resources to tackle the problem. Then, your personal AI can integrate the insights and continue with its task.</p>\n\n<p>This \"nocturnal ecosystem\" of invisible, intelligent agents could operate in parallel with our daily lives, enabling us to wake up to a wealth of new information, connections, or even completed tasks. As AI-powered tools become more prevalent and our devices more powerful, this interconnected web of local and cloud-based AI agents will work together to accomplish goals, optimize time, and offer users a seamless, customized experience.</p><figure class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQHAbR7qYDGn0w\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHAbR7qYDGn0w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1680095294514?e=1744848000&v=beta&t=Qss8XCvizeNUZQcFpSEzWybgIuARJOS9VN34Pa9-_FA\"><figcaption><br>(to the tune of \"All Night Long\" by L.

    "content": "To understand AI, metaphors can be useful: as a tool that fits in your hand, an eager-to-please first-year analyst, etc, BUT...\"\n\"\nI would argue that AI should be understood, first and foremost, as specifically 𝘢 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘷𝘦𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘯𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘨𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘤𝘺𝘣𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘦 (AKA digitized latent space, which continues to expand at an accelerating rate).\n\"\nThis will be an incredible boon for innovators and entrepreneurs who aren't afraid to travel to disparate pockets of the metaverse.\n\"\nHere's what I mean:\n\"\nAI is not a creative tool on its own, but it can catalyze human creativity by allowing individuals to traverse the vast surface area of digitized information and extract insights that are tailored to their goals. This is particularly useful given the increasing low-cost digitization of information, which has created a mind-boggling amount of data that can be accessed through our networks and computing architecture. However, the problem of search has been monopolized by companies like Google, which limits the ability of individual entrepreneurs to access and mine this information set.\n\"\nAI offers a solution to this problem by allowing individuals to perform personalized search functions using large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT algorithms (which helped me turn a voice memo into this post) or Facebook's recently released open-source models. This enables individuals to create their own search engines and traverse the latent space of data quickly and efficiently, extracting insights from voluminous, high fidelity primary sources—then tailor those insights to their immediate needs and context. This unlocks creativity by providing raw material to turbocharge the creative process, allowing individuals to combine insights from disparate sources and solve proximal problems that stand in the way of longer-term goals.\n\"\nFurthermore, AI helps to deal with the problem of overspecialization by translating insights from deep areas of specialization (e.g., those locked up in academic journals and covered in a layer of jargon) into plain English and taking into account the context of the problem being solved. This enables individuals to generate a wide variety of hypotheses and engage in hyper-creative hypothesis generation based on their personal interests and strengths. AI 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝘄𝗻, but it allows individuals to scope and then conduct low-cost experiments to test their hypotheses and develop solutions with economic value.\n\"\nIt's important to note that AI will not generate value automatically, BUT it can catalyze human creativity by allowing individuals to traverse the expanding surface area of digitized information, then extract, translate, and combine insights. This unlocks the potential for creativity and innovation, enabling individuals to solve problems and develop solutions with economic value.\n\"\n\"Ready to dive in?

    "content": "TLDR: Market networks and AI-powered tools are revolutionizing IT innovation, reducing costs, and increasing the success rate of enterprise IT projects, potentially boosting GDP by entire % points\"\n\"\nMarket networks and IT innovation: A paradigm shift\n\"\nIn just the past few months, the field of information technology has begun experiencing a groundbreaking transformation.\n\"\nThis radical change is due to the convergence of global demographic trends, technology diffusion, and the emergence of enabling technologies like artificial intelligence. Now, innovation can occur, and experiments can be conducted at an incredibly low cost by leveraging market networks like Replit \n\"\nThese market networks, powered by a new generation of global talent with access to network computers and AI-driven tools, can address specific needs quickly and affordably. I have personally invested $650 in 3 projects and am amazed by the results, regularly using custom tech developed by engineers on Replit.\n\"\nWhat makes this new paradigm so captivating is that it significantly reduces the risk of whether an IT project's results might be valuable and usable by enterprise end-users. This is because the fixed cost of creating something that can be put into a user's hands has dropped dramatically – by at least one, if not two, orders of magnitude – even today in 2023.\n\"\nThis means that C-suite executives, project managers, and product executives who embrace this innovative IT development approach may be able to reduce costs and increase the chances of achieving their desired outcomes with successful ERP implementations (which currently fail ~75% of the time, according to Gartner) and other enterprise IT projects by as much as 300%.\n\"\nBy adopting this approach and conducting small-scale experiments before committing to resource-intensive projects, the risk of failure in IT projects can be drastically reduced. This is especially relevant for public officials who wish to leverage this new technology and emerging market network paradigm to deliver both private and public IT in the 21st century. \n\"\nAccessing this global, liquid labor market for IT talent and enhancing the likelihood of successful value delivery at scale through enterprise IT projects could push GDP growth as high as 5 or 6 percent – an astonishing increase in economic productivity and wealth creation.\n\"\nThis game-changing paradigm deserves greater attention from both private and public sectors. By harnessing market networks and emerging technologies, we can minimize the risk associated with IT projects, significantly increase success rates, and stimulate unprecedented economic growth.\n\"\n\"#ITInnovation #MarketNetworks #AI #DigitalTransformation #EnterpriseIT",

    "content": "On the eve of widespread access to multimedia generative, AI (GPT-4 is allegedly launching next week), it’s more important than ever that we consider using blockchain infrastructure to stay tethered to reality.\"\n\"\nThe use of blockchain technology for transparency in supply chains gets a lot of attention. Many focus on its application in physical goods to ensure ethical production and sourcing. However, I believe the initial use case for blockchain technology lies in analyzing the information supply chain. By “following the money” (and in the case of cyberspace, reputation and attention invested) nearly instantly, we can understand who's funding the production of a particular bit of digital media and update our interpretation of said media accordingly.\n\"\nPublic blockchain technology can help quickly analyze the provenance and source of a particular piece of information, as well as understand the goals of the different entities that contributed to its production, dissemination, and amplification. This critical infrastructure can aid Americans in making better decisions and differentiating between useful information and disinformation or misinformation.\n\"\nI cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen a tweet with a lot of engagement that is blatant propaganda, and then spent a few minutes digging only to find out that the source is someone affiliated with an obscure organization that, below the opaque surface, has obvious political goals and “interesting” board membership (eg via IRS filings on a non profit site).\n\"\nWe need to make it easier for Americans to discern information from disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation.\n\"\nIn my opinion, this is a promising use case for blockchain technology that the United States government should encourage and even invest in directly. Let us leverage this technology to ensure transparency in the information realm and empower individuals to make informed decisions in the 21st century.\n\"\n\"#blockchain #informationtransparency #criticalinfrastructure #publicsector #innovation",

You can see the other side and where you want to go, but there is a foggy river in the middle, representing the uncertainty and complexity of pursuing a long-term goal. To navigate this foggy river and achieve your long-term objectives, you need clarity on three core components: mission, vision, and present-day position.\n\"\nYour mission is where you're oriented and what only your company should be doing. Your vision is a concrete instantiation of what material reality would look like if you're making headway on that mission. And your present-day position is where you are now, on one side of the river trying to get to the other.\n\"\nOKRs serve as stepping stones across this foggy river, helping teams to align their attention towards a common goal and develop an information edge that fuels growth. By dispersing the fog and uncovering insights, companies can reinvest in their business and ultimately achieve their long-term objectives.\n\"\nSo, what's your next stepping stone? As I said in the presentation, OKRs are most effective when focused on a single quarter, but the art of this is given all of these different options and lots of uncertainty, which direction do you actually step out on into?\n\"\nCheck out the clip for more insights on how OKRs can help you achieve your long-term goals, and share your thoughts on the metaphor of the Foggy River in the comments.\n\"\n\"#OKRs #LongTermGoals #Mission #Vision #InformationEdge #Growth #BusinessStrategy",

    "content": "🔮 What the heck is \"𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲?!\" 🔮\"\n\"\nIt's a powerful tool for startup founders who want highly engaged customers...\n\"\nMatt Zerker spent a whole 2 hours breaking the concept down for me, and I left his workshop feeling energized, ready to use what he taught me to take my own business to the next level.\n\"\nFirst, a definition 👇\n\"\nAccording to ChatGPT, 𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 means \"𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴...\n\"\nIn ancient Greek philosophy and science, it was believed that the world was made up of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. These elements were seen as the building blocks of everything in existence. The fifth element, the 'quinta essentia,' was believed to be a rare and elusive substance that was present in the heavens and was thought to be the purest and most perfect form of matter.\n\"\n𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 is the core means by which an entrepreneur uses his or her product to lead the user to an ideal future.\n\"\n(Fun fact: 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘵 is comes from the Latin roots 𝘱𝘳𝘰- and 𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘦, meaning \"lead forward\")\n\"\nHere's how it works:\n1. Upon first contact with a user, the product 𝘷𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘻𝘦𝘴 the user. In other words, it grabs his or her attention by presenting something novel yet familiar, exciting, or surprising.\n2. Then, it helps the user picture a concrete 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘧𝘶𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦, one where upon having used the product, he or she will have satisfied that desire.\n3. Finally, the product 𝘥𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘭 𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦 toward that promised longer-term end—an invitation to continue using the product.\n\"\nNow, on one hand, this model makes me a little uneasy...it's been used by some tech companies to exploit human weaknesses—to take advantage of the \"7 deadly sins\" as one famous investor put it—and keep them stuck in dopaminergic loops that are highly vitalizing (initially), but ultimately unsatisfying.\n\"\nBUT, on the other hand, the same mechanics can be used by entrepreneurs who want to use technology to help customers achieve long-term, deeply satisfying goals. 🙏\n\"\nJust imagine...you're an entrepreneur who wants to do well by doing good, and you've built a durable, profitable business by doing the right thing & helping your customers flourish...\n\"\nYou can take your very first step by asking your most engaged user (or dream prospect) the following question:\n\"\nIf you could wave a magic wand and change 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, what would it be?\" 🪄\n\"\nYou might be surprised by what they say...\n\"\nThen, when you're ready, take the second step by sending Matt Zerker a DM with their answer, and he'll show you to discover your own product's quintessence and use it to deliver long-term, satisfying value to your customers.\n\"\nCan you remember the last magic moment you experience with a quintessential product?\n\"\n\"Share in the comments 💬",

    "content": "Are you a startup founder who just raised a pre-seed? Congrats!\"\n\"\nWith investor $, you're now playing a high-stakes game...\n\"\nYour goal is to get to seed and PMF ASAP.\n\"\nHere's a quick and easy mindset shift that could save you millions of $ and increase your odds of success:\n\"\n1. Realize that everything is a queue: Your inbox, your thoughts, and every moment that passes in reality - everything is a queue. By acknowledging this, you can start managing your time and resources more effectively.\n2. Make a choice for each item in the queue: As you encounter each item in the queue, you have a choice to make. Do you do something now, delegate it to someone else, or decide not to do it at all?\n3. Assess each item in the queue according to its value and long-term goals: Evaluate each item based on its value to your startup, its alignment with your long-term goals, and how much it vitalizes you. Then, divide this by the cost to resolve it with a proxy of time or money, multiplied by your confidence percentage in those estimated value and cost parameters.\n4. Stack-rank and attend to the first item yourself right now: Once you've assessed each item in the queue, prioritize them in descending order of value and long-term goals. Then, attend to the first item yourself right away.\n5. Decide what not to do: If an item is neither valuable nor vitalizing nor cost-effective, put it out of your mind completely. This will help you focus on the most important tasks.\n6. Delegate to yourself in the future or to others: For high-cost, high-value items, delegate them to yourself in the future during a 2-4 hour morning cycle of deep work. For low-cost, mid-value items that vitalize you, add them to your afternoon shallow work queue. If you don't have an immediate team member who is the perfect fit, consider posting a \"bounty\" for non-dev work on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Fiverr, or post engineering work on Replit.\n7. Delegate to machines: Once you or your delegate has accomplished the same task or solved the same problem with slight variations three times, consider delegating it to software. This could be in the form of SaaS, a duct-taped no-code pipeline, or something completely bespoke like a serverless function that can turn into a source of revenue for your startup.\n\"\nNow, this reality-as-a-queue mindset makes a huge assumption: that you have a high degree of conviction in your long-term goal.\n\"\nTerms like \"mission\" and \"vision\" get thrown around a lot (and scoffed because when they're not crafted carefully, they turn into corporate fluff), but articulating them and getting buy-in from your co-founders is CRUCIAL. They're the core ingredients of everything you'll do on your startup journey...\n\"\nOnce you have those, you're ready to set those medium–long-term goals. I recommend a lightweight approach to OKRs: 1x O, 3 KRs, with weekly exec assessment of confidence scores.\n\"\nMastering the skill of \"managing the queue\" is critical for your startup's success.\n\"\n\"Now, get going!",

    "content": "We are currently living in perhaps the most opportune time in human history to start innovating...\"\n\"\nWith the global talent pool growing more liquid by the day, and market networks like Replit reducing the complexity of connecting, vetting, and incrementally working with credible people from around the world, the cost of innovation is dropping like a rock.\n\"\nBUT, it requires a substantial change in how most innovation units—and even early-stage startups—think about the innovation process.\n\"\nHere are 3 tips for innovators who want to run rapid, effective product experiments at an incredibly low cost:\n\"\n1. Do not accept the status quo: Whenever you run into a problem—e.g., friction in software UX, slow turnaround on a dependency, rote tasks that no one on the immediate team gets vitalized by doing—DO NOT ACCEPT IT! There most likely is a way to achieve your proximal goal 10x faster and 10x cheaper while still getting at least 50% of the quality. Tech (especially AI / LLMs) + the new generation of internet-connected knowledge workers around the world make it possible to delegate the alleviation of even the most incremental frustrations to tiny combinations of labor and capital. You immediately \"feel\" this when you post a Replit bounty for the first time, for example. You don't need a pre-seed round to go 0–1. On Replit, for example, you can get a custom data pipeline or Chrome plugin in less than a week for just $50 or $500, respectively.\n2. Maintain a ruthless, sober focus on results: get away from hours/inputs/etc. and scope micro-engagements with clients and sub-contractors in projects. Once you start collecting checks independently of concrete results, your rate of learning and, thus, innovation will plateau (an aside: industries that have traditionally relied on the billable hour model are RIPE for disruption). Turbo-charge this process w/ cash up-front + satisfaction guarantees for every single engagement.\n3. Accelerate learning with tight feedback loops and micro-accounting: Get away from Quickbooks and instead use a single spreadsheet to account for every teeny tiny bit of revenue and expense in the context of your micro-projects. You'll quickly get a sense of where the margins just by assessing your top-line vs. marginal costs for each. Then you can focus: with greater reliability (ultimately via code), you can drive a wedge deeper into the revenue/COGS gap until you're able to generate passive income with a pure software product.\n\"\nWe're in a new era where you can (and probably should) find PMF before you even start thinking about creating a c-corp.\n\"\nWith access to talent via market networks, tech like LLMs that will increase total factor productivity, and a major dose of humble (and insatiable) curiosity, every one of has can have everything we need to build a capital-efficient bootstrapped business from scratch.\n\"",

They're brittle, so a modicum of discipline goes a long way.\n\"\nBut, to someone who just wants to build quickly that sounds a lot like, \"eat your broccolli\": You know should do it, but you really don't want to.\n\"\nHe suggested instead using tools like nScale to help you get your arms around your massive tangle of no code pipelines.\n\"\nHe's even coded a custom tool that allows you to find exactly the variable you want across all of the different no code tools and pipelines that fit together to give you (or your boss or your client) the result that you want.\n\"\nSo, if you're a no-code user looking for insights and tips to streamline your workflow (and find those hidden variables causing you problems), consider sending him a DM to find out more: 🚀 Ambroise Dhenain\n\"\n\"#nocode #startup #streamline #work",

When we found content that caught our attention and demonstrated credibility, we went directly to the author in a direct message and asked them to help out with what we working on.\nWe had no idea who or where they were—they were just avatars in a Discord channel—but we started with micro-projects to test their talent and professionalism.\n\"\nEven though 50% of the people we paid for project-based work didn’t ultimately stick with us, the other half did in a big way!\n\"\nUltimately, a team of engineers and designers from Hong Kong to Mexico delivered nearly 20 completely custom VR therapy environments for only a few thousand dollars.\n\"\nWe were able to start testing our very first with a psychologist and his patient in 2 weeks—not 2 months!\n\"\nThe key was going to talent directly and delegating results-driven micro-projects, rather than simply “outsourcing” the whole process.\n\"\nFor early-stage companies, there’s always been a lot to be gained from getting your hands dirty.

But, to disperse the fog, you've got to move forward. And to move forward, you've got to move together (with the rest of your team, likely to be globally distributed in 2023).\n\"\nAnd this all requires effective, proximal goal-setting.\n\"\nWhen I work with clients, I do everything I can to help them move quickly, efficiently, and skillfully in the right direction (hence, the importance of selecting just \"one objective to rule them all\").\n\"\nBut, at quarter's end, whether or not you achieved your key results is less important than what you learned along the way—insights that can be transformed into your information edge, the ultimate source of profit.\n\"\nIn my experience, when things really go right, you DON'T achieve all three (if you did, you were sandbagging...).\n\"\nInstead, you end up getting what you want, but not in the way you expect: You've created outsized value for your customers, picked up a few new tricks, and grown personally and professionally in ways you never could have expected before you embarked on your latest three-month journey.\n\"\nAnd, perhaps most interestingly, upon reflection it becomes clear that things couldn't have gone any other way. You got results that were unexpected, yet inevitable.\n\"\nWhen you're in the messy middle of another leg of building your startup, just remember that the entrepreneurial journey is not unlike the hero's journey, that truth is often stranger than fiction, and that fiction is often the best way to communicate (as Micah would say) \"Truth-with-a-capital-T.\n\"\nThat process of venturing out into the unknown is often what energizes us when we watch an engaging film, read a thrilling book, or hack-and-slash through the latest blockbuster video game...\n\"\n\"But what we really want is the REAL THING, and there's no better way to get it than courageously making your way across the \"foggy river\" as an entrepreneur: https://lnkd.in/e5Vs-YNu",

And having to write up summaries for the team takes your time away from critical action items.\n\"\n🔢 Follow the steps in this tutorial to delegate note-taking and summarization to your very own AI assistant!\n\"\n💬 What other CoS tasks would you like to spend less time doing?

    "content": "Until very recently, I had debilitating social (media) anxiety.\"\n\"\nFrom my teens through my 20s, I was extremely nervous about posting anything online, in part due to a healthy dose of paranoia from my parents (\"What ever you publish online, stays there forever!\"), but also because I felt like I didn't have anything cool, interesting, or useful to share.\n\"\nSo, today I had a great session w/ social media expert (and LinkedIn wizard) Mitch Stein about how to develop a healthier relationship with social media and build an authentic digital presence.\n\"\nHis advice?\n\"\nBe more human, online.\n\"\nI sometimes joke with friends that in the age of zero-cost digitization and publishing, \"We're all Kardashians now.\n\"\nWhile it's easy to focus on the negative aspects of socializing in cyberspace—reality show toxicity and drama brought into the digital public square, self-oriented \"influencer\" culture, clickbait kings who figure out how to hack content algorithms (and our invaluable attention)—there's at least as much to be gained from making meaningful contributions to the online world.\n\"\nIn fact, I first met Mitch online, via a virtual founders' support group started by Alessandro Cetera nearly 2 years ago, and recently had the opportunity to meet him IRL!\n\"\nWhile, yes, posting on social media can be a great way to get ideas out there (and there are few things I love more than philosophizing about cutting-edge technology, management science, and corporate strategy via dense LinkedIn posts...), it's ALSO a great way to build new, meaningful, and trust-based relationships with other people who you'd never have otherwise had the opportunity to meet.\n\"\nTIL that this is contingent upon:\n\"\n1. Meeting people where they are (I'll be thinking a bit more about how to package some of my more abstract ideas in a way that's most relevant/valuable to the people I want to invite to participate in a public conversation);\n2. Telling stories clearly (the same core info is more likely to be received when it's packaged into a natural-sounding anecdote vs. a highfalutin/verbose think piece); and\n3. Being yourself (while LinkedIn is NOT the same as your private friends/family chat group, it's good to be a bit vulnerable/weave your authentic personality into professional content).\n\"\nMitch, thanks for all the great tips today!

    "content": "If you’re using social media (or any digital medium for that matter), it’s important to ponder the following question…\"\n\"\n“What is my goal here?”\n\"\nPersonally, I find it useful to break down social media use into two buckets: R&D and marketing, both of which show up on your income statement.\n\"\nOf course posting content, participating in public conversations, and reaching out to individuals via DM are means of ultimately creating customers—all marketing activities.\n\"\nHowever, using social media for the purposes of research and development can be at least as valuable as “pure marketing” activity.\n\"\nHow can you use these channels for R&D?\n\"\nI like to test new ideas and heuristics by getting them out in the open, even when they’re not quite fully baked.\n\"\nFirst, I’ll work the idea (usually a mental model or a new variation on a framework I use) into a conversation with a client.\n\"\nThen, if it’s received well, I’ll put it into practice to help them solve a particular problem. If we get good results, I’ll try to get one or two more repetitions in with another client to see if I can reliably get the desired result.\n\"\nFinally, I’ll package that idea into a LinkedIn post (my current workflow is to record a daily\nmonologue during my morning walk, transcribe it w/ AI, query my monologue with OpenAI ‘s GPT-3 to extract key points and create 4-5 drafts of the post, and put finishing touches manually).\n\"\nIf it gets engagement, sparks and interesting discussion, or attracts DMs, then it might be worth investing in further. If not, all good—I de-risk it sooner.\n\"\nThis makes it much easier to vet ideas by making incremental contact with reality, far short of packaging knowledge into information products with significantly higher fixed costs: e.g. writing an entire book.\n\"\nMaking this a nigh-daily weekday habit has yielded good results (and revenue 🙂), forcing me to improve the quality of my thinking and rapidly evolve my service offerings, messaging, and positioning.\n\"\nIt’s important to note that, unfortunately, due to the advertisement-based business models that power social media platforms, you have to install a bit of discipline if you want to use them primarily for the purposes of marketing and research and development. The default user experiences are designed for frictionless consumption rather than production, and that means that you need to do a little bit of planning to ensure that you’re really getting value out of these media.\n\"\nBut if you produce more than you consume, you’ll be just fine!\n\"\n(And you’ll feel less guilty when you quantify the hours, and therefore dollars, you put into platform use, since those fixed cost investments into R&D and marketing yield professional leverage.)\n\"\n\" #marketing #research #socialmedia #linkedin",

    "content": "If you want to build wealth in the age of AI, you should start thinking about where you can provide value by removing bottlenecks; bottlenecks = entrepreneurial and commercial opportunities.\"\n\"\nIn my estimation, there are already a few places where great companies will emerge:\n\"\n1. Foundational model creation: The limiting factors here are compute, energy, and ML scientist talent. There will be a few hyper-centralized players (e.g., OpenAI) that can afford the ever-rising fixed costs to training. Upstarts that can achieve breakthroughs in hardware, software, and model architecture that even marginally decrease these fixed costs will have an opportunity to serve these centralized corporations and exit via acquisition.\n\"\n2. Digitization: We're already running out of training data! And, if you think about it, all of the data on the internet isn't even that high-resolution (yet). Companies like Rewind AI are making digitization (and storage) easier and less expensive. My guess is there's a lot of opportunity to build hyper-specialized workflow tools that include recording capabilities (just wait until Apple releases their augmented reality product line...). Privacy and security will be of the utmost importance. Lots of innovation yet to be done in that problem space.\n\"\n3. Private/public agent interfaces: I have a hunch that internet business models will finally move away from advertising and toward metering. You pay for what you consume; AI should be viewed as a utility like electricity, so this makes sense. Additionally, all profit is ultimately downstream of an information edge, so individuals and corporations will want to protect their private repositories. How those repositories are processed, monetized, etc. will be very interesting to see unfold—and THIS bottleneck is actually the most interesting to me. My guess is the new equilibrium looks something like various AI agents, aware of private and goal-driven contextual information, using compute to barter and negotiating with each other overnight, then surfacing qualified prospect opportunities to their owners. This should decrease the expensive \"search\" process by which supply and demand meet and surplus is maximized, thereby creating lots of surface for all parties and, thus, unprecedented wealth.\n\"\nI'm not really aware of any startups tackling that 3rd bottleneck (marketing chatbots are sort of in this space, but I'm thinking about an even more radical approach), and I look forward to seeing the innovation ecosystem explode in the years ahead!\n\"\nWhere else should entrepreneurs be looking for opportunities to create real value with #artificialintelligence?\n\"\nLike this post and add a comment with your thoughts!\n\"\n\"#innovation #entrepreneurship #ai #startups",

    "content": "In the same way there's really no difference between (sound) strategy and tactics, there's also no difference between customer discovery and sales.\"\n\"\nInstead, it's more useful for entrepreneurs and innovators to perceive a gradient from discovery to revenue generation. With that mindset, it becomes significantly easier to go \"0 to 1\" with a new offering and acquire your first users and, ideally, customers (in fact, the latter can—and should, I would argue—precede the former).\n\"\nIf you'd like to quickly explore and vet a hunch you have about a new market opportunity, here's an extremely fast and effective way to create your first customers (or identify limiting factors that make the idea not yet worth pursuing, ultimately saving yourself a ton of time and energy):\n\"\n1. Articulate your hunch as a set of hypotheses, which usually are some combination of \"there is a problem,\" \"the pain is great,\" \"many people have the pain,\" \"those people are willing to pay for pain relief,\" \"the cost of delivering pain relief is less than they're willing to pay,\" and \"the sum of the difference between WTP and my costs across my first 10 customers exceed my market salary.\n2. Reach out to 5 people who fit your target profile and offer them 1.5x their hourly wage for a 25m recorded customer discovery interview.\n3. Get them into storytelling mode by asking them to share concrete anecdotes related to where you think their pain might be.\n4. Pay attention to their emotional valence: when they're elated, that means there's something in the story that they really like, and when they're upset, that means there are limiting factors (you may or may not be able to remove). Enough pain + you can reliably remove those limiting factors = potential commercial opportunity.\n5. Upon discovering pain, ask, \"If I could wave a wand and relieve [pain] right now, what would be an offensive amount of money for me to ask for from you?\" Their answer is the order-of-magnitude ticket price for your offering. Offer it at 10–50% of the \"offensive\" rate with a money-back guarantee and see if they pay you. If so, congrats, you just created your first customer without a website or single line of code.\n6. At the end of the interview, share a one-line description of what you're up to. If they're interested, they will ask questions or schedule a follow up. If not, they're not a qualified prospect; let it go and thank them for their time.\n7. In a Google Sheet row, write 3–5 insights from the interview, give yourself feedback on quality of interview questions and process, and then save links to the recording/transcript.\n8. Send them the gift card.\n\"\nIf you do this 50x times (and update your hypothesis/Bayesian priors along the way), I GUARANTEE you will find out if there's a \"there there.\n\"\n\"Of course, this is an art at least as much as a science, so if you're interested in learning the art of effective & efficient customer discovery, send me a DM or sign up for a free consult (link in my profile)!",

    "content": "There is a lot of (well founded) concern amongst teachers about the problems AI poses to the educational process and broader system, e.g., GPT-3–generated book reports.\"\n\"\nInstead of working against AI, I would recommend educators to consider fundamentally rethinking workflow and process when it comes to their work with students (and, by extension, any kind of creative information or knowledge-based output).\n\"\nAI actually ENHANCES creativity by augmenting divergent thinking and making convergent thinking more efficient (see attached image).\n\"\nThis is a good thing: the public education system has traditionally had an emphasis on control and standardization, and AI allows for more individual differentiation, thereby increasing the range of ideas available for students to explore and inviting them to develop novel syntheses that can be critiqued and refined in social settings.\n\"\nAI can help teachers in this regard by allowing them to:\n\"\n1. Change the nature of the assignments that they do,\n2. Encouraging students to use artificial intelligence, and\n3. Reconfiguring the rubrics by which they grade assignments or essays to be optimized for creativity, utility, and quality.\n\"\nFor example, instead of just expecting students to write a book report about a particular book, teachers can raise the bar and have students come up with some kind of original thought or intertextual reading between that book and something else in which they're deeply interested. Students might use a discursive AI agent to explore ideas or topics contained within the text that interest them, and the AI might even pose critical thinking questions to them—all the while their discourse is recorded and trascribed, raw material for original writing.\n\"\nWith AI assistance, the quality of the work that students can do in the same amount of time should be significantly higher.\n\"\nOn the teacher side, AI can help by looking at the corpus of submitted essays or assignments and surfacing the most compelling, unique, and interesting insights for an emotionally charged group discussion during class.\n\"\nSubmission would be judged not on their merits as summaries of the original text, but at a much higher level: on their originality and creative interpretation.\n\"\nTeachers can also use the extra time freed up by machine assistance to do relational work with the students who would really benefit from a 1:1 intervention: e.g., to tease out their motivations, provide encouragement, and remove limits to creative potential.\n\"\nWith AI assistance, teachers and students can spend more time doing things that are MORE HUMAN, create higher quality work more efficiently, make better use of common classroom time, and accelerate subject mastery.\n\"\n\"#artificialintelligence #education #creativity",

Their ambitious, yet attainable objective was to:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Substantially reduce door-to-door time for crypto oligarchs during day trips to charter cities in Latin America by March 1st, 2023</strong></p>\n\n<p>Their three key results were:</p><ol><li>3 letters of intent signed with Latin American charter city authorities</li><li>10 paid round trips to Prospera (a charter city in Costa Rica)</li><li>1 whale (a crypto whale with more than 250,000 followers) tweets about their experience flying with them</li></ol><h3>Good Objective and Key Results Example <strong>#2</strong> – Mental Health Startup</h3>\n\n<p>This example is for a mental health startup that uses VR to connect therapists with kids. They had recently discovered that their technology was the best fit for providers who had to switch to Zoom during the pandemic, but had difficulty getting neurodiverse clients to stay attentive and focused during remote session. Their objective was to:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Help licensed mental health professionals across the US achieve breakthroughs with neurotypical adolescent clients via remote talk therapy in virtual reality by June 3rd, 2022</strong></p>\n\n<p>Their three key results were:</p><ol><li>50 therapists using the platform with at least one client</li><li>1 group practice w/ >5 providers purchases >2 platform licenses</li><li>3 provider video testimonials published that include “ADHD” and/or “autism”</li></ol><h3>Good Objective and Key Results Example <strong>#3</strong> – Biotech AI Platform Startup</h3>\n\n<p>This example is for a biotech AI start-up. After pivoting from a point solution to a platform strategy, they wanted to aggregate as much supply as possible and demonstrate that their was some non-zero demand for web-based, AI-driven biotech data analysis by clinical researchers around the world. Their objective was to:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Help drug discovery AI developers at top research institutions go code-to-clinic faster than ever by December 15, 2019</strong></p>\n\n<p>Their three key results were:</p><ol><li>23 third-party AI tiles on a storefront</li><li>100 analyzed datasets interacted with through the web interface</li><li>$50,000 of CRO services booked</li></ol><h3>Good Objective and Key Results Example <strong>#4</strong> – Healthcare (Ultrasound device) Startup</h3>\n\n<p>This example is for another healthcare start-up that was going to market with their recently FDA-approved cardiac ultrasound, targeting a brand new market segment that they had never made contact with; they aimed to:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Connect professionally organized tier-one community centers into the cloud by transforming their provider’s cardiac ultrasound workflows by March 12, 2020</strong></p>\n\n<p>Their three key results were:</p><ol><li>200 new leads contacted</li><li>20 demos given</li><li>1 center of excellence letter of intent signed</li></ol><p>Note that 1 and 2 are examples of a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_okrs-strategy-management-activity-7011775256218460161-EFIZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\">\"quality input\" and a \"vital outcome,\"</a> respectively.</p>\n\n<h3>Good Objective and Key Results Example <strong>#5</strong> – US to Japan Freight Company</h3>\n\n<p>This example is for a company that does US to Japan specialized freight shipping. After executives returned from a few weeks at the front lines of Japanese trade authority offices, they observed that there were key issues that they were uniquely equipped to tackle that were preventing their customers from being able to reliably predict when the authorities would approve their shipments of high-end critical semiconductor manufacturing components for export by plane.</p>\n\n<p>Their objective was then to:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Make our semiconductor SMB manufacturers fall in love with us by urgently unblocking US to Japan hypersonic air freight shipments by October 10 2021</strong></p>\n\n<p>Their three key results were:</p><ol><li>One customer double-spend versus three previous three month period</li><li>3 gushing video testimonials published to marketing site</li><li><12-hour average wait time at customs over trailing seven days</li></ol><h3>Good Objective and Key Results Example <strong>#6</strong> – Health Tech Company</h3>\n\n<p>This example is for another health tech company that provides specialized fertility health services, mostly via telehealth. They discovered that handwritten letters to primary care physicians yielded lots of referrals, but they didn't know why and wondered whether other types of upstream providers might refer patients as well.</p>\n\n<p>Their objective was to:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reliably generate new patient demand via physician referrals by March 28, 2023</strong></p>\n\n<p>Their three key results were:</p><ol><li>30 new patients acquired via physician referrals</li><li>6 physician outreach experiments run</li><li>1 patient referred by a non-primary care physician/endocrinologist</li></ol><h3>Good Objective and Key Results Example <strong>#7</strong> – HR Tech Startup (pre-seed)</h3>\n\n<p>This example is from 2 founders at the beginning of their start-up journey, before they'd even incorporated the company. They set out to use AI and psychographic data to revolutionize strengths-based talent management within remote corporations.</p>\n\n<p>Their very first objective was to:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Find out if there’s a \"there there\" for a 10-year start of journey toward creating a human capital platform unicorn by December 2nd 2018</strong></p>\n\n<p>Their three key results were:</p><ol><li>100 insight-generating primary market research interviews with HR buyers and benefits advisors</li><li>2 psychographic diagnostic reviewed together</li><li>1 letter of intent signed with a total contract value of greater than $100k</li></ol><h2>Not-so-great Objective and Key Results Examples</h2>\n\n<p>Now let’s look at some examples of less-than-ideal objectives and key results.</p>\n\n<h3>Bad objectives</h3><ul><li><strong>Become a multi product company</strong>: This is non-specific and self-oriented, and focused on outputs (the products) rather than outcomes (what the products do).</li><li><strong>Grow revenue</strong>: Not specific, unclear why this would be a good strategy, and no choices made or crux of the problem identified.</li><li><strong>Make our customers love us</strong>: Good sentiment but how and for whom this should be done is not defined.</li><li><strong>Run 10 performance marketing experiments</strong>: This could be a good key result, but it’s quantitative and not a good objective.</li><li><strong>Document all processes in Notion</strong>: This is more a task than an objective, and lacks clarity on the desired end goal.</li></ul><h3>Bad key results</h3><ul><li><strong>Ship 10 updates</strong>: This is focused on outputs as opposed to outcomes, and may not solve a real problem for customers.</li><li><strong>100 app downloads</strong>: While this may demonstrate interest, it does not necessarily lead to providing value or delivering users their desired outcome.</li><li><strong>30% decrease in cost of acquiring a customer</strong>: Unclear where this is starting from and without more context, it’s not a good measure (drawing a line in the sand of acceptable CAC would be better).</li><li><strong>Increase revenue</strong>: Not even quantitative.</li><li><em>Very clever measure that requires some additional instrumentation</em>: While clever, this measure isn’t immediately available and should be saved for a later quarter.

    "content": "Setting good key results is essential to successful Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).\"\n\"\nPreviously, I've written about what makes for a good objective.\n\"\nKnowing what criteria to look for when creating key results will help you craft a unified OKR, and help achieve the results you want.\n\"\nThose six criteria are \"quantitative,\" \"concrete,\" \"information efficient,\" \"coherent,\" \"stewarded,\" and \"exclusive.\n\"\nQuantitative: Each key result should be measurable. This means having a metric or a line in the sand that is binary, in that it is either achieved or not at the end of the quarter.\n\"\nConcrete: Make sure the key result is specific enough that everyone agrees on the definition. The key result should be measurable right when it's set—not in the future. If the result can’t be measured right away, opt for a proxy or imperfect approximation of the result. You can test this criterion by asking execs to pull the metric's value RIGHT NOW, and if they get the same numbers, it's a concrete measure.\n\"\nInformation Efficient: Each key result should provide information that the other two key results don’t. This doesn't mean \"uncorrelated\" per se. It can be satisfied by selecting one vital outcome and one quality input (which may be correlated in space, but not time—i.e., leading vs. lagging indicators). If the outcome takes a long time to achieve, the quality input will help the team focus on pulling proximal, reliable levers. \n\"\nCoherent: All key results should fit together into a unified whole, both with each other and the objective. This can be tested by asking yourself whether achieving all the key results will also result in achieving the objective. \n\"\nStewarded: Each key result should have a steward. This person is responsible for having access to the right information to know the odds of end-of-quarter KR success at any given time. While their confidence score should be gut-driven, it should be informed by accurate and useful information they have gathered over the course of the week, and is shared at the weekly LT sync meeting.\n\"\nExclusive: If you want extra constraints on the key result, you can make it more exclusive. For example, saying a key result should only pertain to a particular segment or geography will make it more focused and precise. This allows you to achieve additional depth (at the cost of breadth).\n\"\nBy understanding the criteria for setting good key results, you can craft objectives that lead to successful OKRs. These criteria will help you create unified goals and increase the probability of achieving the results you want.\n\"\n\"#okrs #strategy #management",

    "content": "In my work with clients, no matter startup size or stage, I recommend they set a single objective and three key results (OKRs) for the entire company.\"\n\"\nWith everything riding on this unified objective, it's especially important that the executive team selects and articulates good and effective OKRs.\n\"\nLet's first define what an objective and key results are. An objective is a qualitative quarterly goal, while the key results are quantitative measures that fit back into the objective, allowing you to know clearly whether or not the overarching goal has been achieved.\n\"\nSo, what makes for a good objective?\n\"\n(I'll talk about key results in a subsequent post.)\n\"\nHere's a template: \"do X for Y by Z by A.\n\"\nStart with a verb, such as “do X” in the context of a particular stakeholder, \"Y.\" This is usually the customer. Then, optionally, you can add how you will do it if you want to further constrain the objective (\"Z\"); “by A” refers to the time constraint, usually 12 weeks from when you set the OKRs.\n\"\nGood objectives should have six criteria: ambitious, aligned, prudent, strategic, qualitative, and charitable. \n\"\nAmbitious objectives are inspiring (but achievable)—something that gets the whole team excited.\n\"\nAligned objectives are in line with the mission and vision of the company.\n\"\nBeing prudent means acknowledging capital constraints (do a financial model first!) and having a plausible narrative that connects the objective to the ultimate goal. While you can't know the future, you should at least be able to make a reasonable argument as to why taking this next step would logically connect to subsequent steps that ultimately allow you to achieve your mission and vision.\n\"\nObjectives should also be strategic. Focusing on the crux of the problem (to use Richard Rumelt's terminology) along a vertical hierarchy of choices along with the correct, limited range across a horizontal set of mutually exclusive choices are both important. The point here is that you're making a conscious and difficult choice to focus on one point of leverage (at the exclusion of others) that is likely to yield outsized progress and insights over the next quarter.\n\"\nObjectives should also be qualitative (no measure), allowing for  flexibility and room for personal projection (and, thus, ownership) by every member of the team.\n\"\nLastly, objectives should be charitable, meaning they should focus on the needs of the primary external stakeholder (e.g., the customer); the purpose of a corporation is to create value by solving problems using an information edge, and THEN capturing some of this value as profit returned to shareholders, hence the power of taking a charitable—and not self-oriented—approach to goal-setting.\n\"\nBy keeping these criteria in mind when setting OKRs, you can make sure that your objectives and key results are effective in helping you achieve your goals.\n\"\nNext up: 6 criteria for good key results...keep an eye out for my next post!\n\"\n\"#OKRs #management #strategy",

This means that, in the context of sales, the processes around building rapport, probing for pain, finding a decision-making unit, and uncovering a prospect's willingness to pay could all be disrupted and transformed by AI. \n\"\nThis is because certain AI algorithms, developed by researchers at DeepMind, Meta, and other institutions for the purpose of winning certain games (e.g., Go, Poker, Diplomacy) have proven extremely successful in running simulations of AI playing itself that cover a much broader range than had ever been considered by traditional master players.\n\"\nThis has exposed previously unknown pockets of abstract space, unthought-of strategies, and more optimal solutions that have had much better results.\n\"\nWhat does this mean for the business world?\n\"\nAs an example, companies collecting high-fidelity recordings of every conversation, video chat, etc. between their salespeople and prospects can create AI agents that are virtual representations of their salespeople and simulate interactions to explore a much wider possibility space.

    "content": "Objectives and key results (OKRs) help businesses and teams stay focused on their goals and measure progress towards those goals. When executed properly, OKRs can lead to outsized results and help businesses and teams reach their full potential. It’s no wonder that they’re gaining popularity amongst executives and teams around the world.\"\n\"\nIn my recent presentation to the Chief of Staff Network (thanks, Rahul Desai and David Nebinski for hosting!), I outlined the three essential steps for successfully implementing OKRs. The first step is to set OKRs. This involves an executive workshop of around five hours, preceded by preparatory trust-building and information gathering activities. At the end of the workshop, you should have one objective and three key results. These should be ambitious enough that there is a 50/50 chance of achieving them in a quarter. Each key result should also have a steward who is accountable for knowing the odds of success of achieving that key result.\n\"\nThe second step is to sync weekly, which involves a meeting of around an hour to surface new information, make plans to exploit that information towards the end of outsized progress. The third step is to reflect quarterly, which is when we \"uncover the truth,\" mine insights, and shape company culture.\n\"\nThe pitfalls to avoid when setting and tracking OKRs include: having more than one objective and three key results; sharing OKRs with external stakeholders (who will inevitably mistake a tool for learning for committed targets); skipping weekly check-ins; and allowing the weekly syncs to descend into status update hell.\n\"\nFor teams of 300 people or less, weekly syncs are the key to success. This is when the key stakeholders come together to discuss progress on the key results and assign a confidence score of how likely they are to be achieved. This is also the time to identify any heroic narratives, i.e. a team member who went above and beyond expectations to achieve a key result.\n\"\nFinally, communication is key in this process. This can include recording and transcribing meetings, conducting anonymous surveys, and using a technique called \"backbriefing,\" where the strategic intent is communicated to everyone on the team.\n\"\n\"Overall, setting and tracking OKRs is essential to achieving business objectives, and it’s important to have an effective system in place to ensure that teams stay on track and progress is monitored effectively and efficiently.

Start recording EVERYTHING and grow your private information repository: Rewind AI and recorded conversations (with all parties' full consent, of course) via Google Meet or Zoom are great starting points. (When Apple's AR arrives, things will get really interesting...) I'd also recommend recording daily monologues about topics that are interesting to you, so you can mine them for valuable content (I did this last week to create a LinkedIn post...will share how I did later this week). This private knowledge repository WILL BE the source of your personal information edge, and thus, ability to grow wealth.\n\"\n2. Make time every day to practice using AI as a part of your workflow. OpenAI's ChatGPT is already ready. Ask it questions like it was a first-year analyst and give it knowledge work tasks at the same level (presentation outlines, email drafts, etc.). If you'd like to take things to the next level, try your hand at Midjourney or tune GPT to meet your more bespoke needs via the OpenAI Playground.\n\"\nUnfortunately, I think there are many knowledge workers and corporate leaders who will try to resist these changes (already artist communities are starting to declare Butlerian jihads against AI...), but if you can lean into the transformation as soon as possible, your future self will thank you for it.\n\"\nAre you ready to start wielding AI on a daily basis?!\n\"\nLike and reshare this post with a comment about how you might be able to use AI in your work today...\n\"\n\"#ai #digitaltransformation #technology #ar",

    "content": "As economists Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb have noted in their bestselling book \"Power and Prediction: The Disruptive Economics of Artificial Intelligence,\" technology is most disruptive when it enables the creation of new systems (versus point solutions and applications).\"\n\"\nIn the book, they point out that while ultimately of marginal value in the context of existing systems, electricity proved transformational when it enabled entirely new systems of production (e.g., factories and machines, untethered from the energy source).\n\"\nSimilarly, I believe that AI, spatial computing, and public blockchain ledgers (all technologies that are currently of marginal value) will allow us to rebuild the corporation from first principles, untethering knowledge workers from space, time, and cultural context.\n\"\nThis new corporation will be glued together by a \"private AI,\" continuously fed streams of high-fidelity, proprietary information: meeting recordings and even real-time capture of knowledge work product creation via tools like Rewind AI. This will make it easier for information to be consumed and shared asynchronously, as employees' primary communication channel will be the corporate AI. Think: a Slack DM (or, more likely, a private Urbit group channel) you can ping at any point for the info you need to get your work done.\n\"\nThe cost of knowledge capture, management, and transfer goes essentially to zero, freeing up managers' time for more valuable (and largely relational) work, e.g., longer/more substantive 1:1s.\n\"\nThis new corporation will also tap into an unprecedentedly liquid global labor market. With on-chain reputation systems, we can verify that someone is credible while preserving their privacy, allowing us to transact with them on the blockchain.\n\"\nThis removes the need for costly and inefficient hiring processes that assume full-time employment. Hiring will happen incrementally and be project-based.\n\"\nReliable, real-time translation will lower linguistic barriers; cultural barriers are already coming down as the next generation of workers will have grown up largely on the internet, allowing them to access common contexts regardless of where they were born.\n\"\nFinally, spatial computing will allow us to convene remotely—primarily for the purpose of generating emotional energy and building trust, NOT information sharing. We'll be fully liberated from our desks. Employees will be able to more easily build bonds via VR games like Rec Room, an activity that's far superior to Zoom happy hours...\n\"\nAI, VR/AR, and blockchain will allow us build new systems of coordinated human action—the 21st-century corporation—from first principles, generate unprecedented wealth, and free up our invaluable attention for activities—literally and figuratively—outside of the office.\n\"\n#ai #technology #vr #blockchain #futureofwork\n\"\n\"https://lnkd.in/ecDxgJbY",

They are (from lowest to highest):\n\"\n1. \"Eikasia,\" roughly our immediate emotion responses to raw inputs from our immediate environment;\n2. \"Pistis,\" simple heuristics and \"just-so\" stories that use to quickly make sense of a stream of raw input;\n3. \"Dianoia,\" discursive critical thinking, through which we consider multiple interpretations and use reason; and\n4. \"Noesis,\" a deep, generalizable understanding that's almost like catching a glimpse of the source code of reality.\n\"\nThe thing is, moving up each level of the pyramid requires focus and unbroken periods of concentrated attention — so, if you're constantly distracted, moving from one external input to another, you'll inevitably get stuck at the lower levels. And if you stay stuck, then you'll never be able to get at the root of whatever it is you're trying to accomplish.\n\"\nHow does this play out in the digital age?\n\"\nLet's take social media—Twitter to be very specific—as an example:\n\"\nTweets are incredibly short, and because the algorithm is optimized for engagement, the tweets that are mostly likely to draw your attention (in other words, the most potent external stimuli at the level of eikasia) end up at the top of your feed.\n\"\nIt's no wonder Twitter threads get adversarial and stay so emotionally heated! The medium is simply not conducive to moving past (at best) pistis ... everyone's simple heuristics/worldviews are further simplified and reinforced; nuance, the thing that emerges at the stage of dianoia, is lost.\n\"\nWhile perhaps less extreme, the same principle holds true for every other digital channel: from Slack to email inboxes to LinkedIn posts :)\n\"\nKnowledge work is ultimately about developing a practical understanding of the world that can be used to help people achieve their goals more effectively and efficiently.\n\"\nTrue understanding (those precious \"a-ha\" moments) requires movement up (and then back down) Plato's Pyramid.\n\"\nWhat does this mean in practice?\n\"\nWell, in an age of infinite digital breadth, it's more important than ever to develop a disciplined approach to achieving depth: e.g., attenuating digital distractions, batching your inboxes, and carving out ample time to contemplate.\n\"\nReady to go deeper on a daily basis?\n\"\nAdd your tips for staying focused and \"thinking better\" in the comments!\n\"\n\"#digital #work #socialmedia #focus #philosophy #productivity",

    "content": "Are you a Chief-of-Staff struggling to get your team in sync and hyper-focused?\"\n\"\nYou might have something to learn from this one 2,300-year-old Greek guy...\n\"\nWhen it comes to company success, there are many factors at play, such as strong leadership, a clear vision, and a solid business model. But if you want to dig deeper and understand the underlying mechanisms that drive your organization's success, you may want to look at Aristotle's \"four causes.\n\"\nAristotle's four causes are a concept from ancient Greek philosophy that can be applied to various fields, including corporate strategy and management.\n\"\nThe four causes are:\n\"\n1. The final cause (the purpose or end that something serves),\n2. The formal cause (the shape or form that something takes),\n3. The material cause (the physical substance out of which something is made), and\n4. The efficient cause (the agent or force that brings something into being).\n\"\nIn the context of company strategy, the final cause is the ultimate goal that the company is striving to achieve. There are multiple \"final causes\" at any given time: long-term vision and infinite mission, a proximal quarterly objective, and the priority atop your daily task list.\n\"\nTo maximize team cohesion and coordinated action, all of these should be chained together.\n\"\nThe formal cause is also important in corporate strategy. This is the shape or form that the company's strategy takes. It is both explicit (e.g., management processes, stated values) and implicit (e.g., unspoken cultural norms).\n\"\nIn particular, the process of setting, syncing, and reflecting upon quarterly objectives (OKRs) is a key aspect of the formal cause. By establishing clear and measurable goals, and regularly reviewing and adjusting them, companies can ensure that their strategy is well-defined and focused on achieving their final cause, thereby cohering the final with the formal.\n\"\nThe material and efficient causes also play important roles.\n\"\nThe material cause refers to the resources and assets that a company uses to achieve its goals. This includes financial capital, human talent, proprietary technology, and access to insular networks.\n\"\nThe efficient cause is the agent or force that brings the company's strategy into being. This is where human attention comes into play. In the age of digital distraction, companies need to create conditions that allow knowledge workers maximize their individual attention, align their daily activities with sources of intrinsic motivation, and direct that catalyzed attention towards a shared final cause (i.e., a mission-aligned quarterly objective).\n\"\nIn conclusion, Chiefs-of-Staff can think about supporting their principals in the context of Aristotle's four causes: articulating a final cause, catalyzing efficient causes, implementing formal causes, and maximizing material causes.\n\"\nHow can you apply Aristotle's 4 causes in your own work?\n\"\nLet me know in the comments!\n\"\n\"#chiefofstaff #startup #strategy #management #philosophy #okr",

    "content": "When you're managing a remote team, running effective cross-functional team meetings—especially with execs—is absolutely critical.\"\n\"\nA 2-hour meeting with 5 executives during deep work hours costs the company ~$2,500!\n\"\nYou wouldn't waste thousands of dollars of cash...so, why not hold meetings to the same high standards?\n\"\nPut that invaluable group attention to work with the following best practices:\n\"\n1. Articulate clear outcomes and outputs before creating an agenda. Your agenda should be a function of your goal, not the other way around.\n2. Block 2 hours for all remote meetings. I know this sounds crazy, but outsized progress requires periods of unbroken focus, and we're able to achieve our deepest levels of focus in 90-minute \"ultradian cycles.\" If you can achieve the same outcome via other channels (e.g., asynchronous comments on a shared document), do that instead.\n3. Share meeting outcomes, outputs, and a time-boxed agenda in the invite. I wish Google Apps for Business could force users to do this before being able to invite anyone to a meeting...\n4. Spend the first 10 minutes reviewing the outcomes, outputs, sharing an \"up-front contract\" (UFC), setting ground rules, and sharing \"top-of-minds\" (TOMs). The UFC should give attendees the leeway to exit the meeting at any point if they feel it's not worth their attention. Ground rules should include filtering out all digital distractions. By verbalizing what's TOM (work or personal) for each attendee, that competing priority is neutralized.\n5. Hit record. Going forward (and thanks to AI), the organizations that commit to radical transparency by recording and sharing meetings by default will have a massive advantage over those that do not by radically decreasing the biggest cost drivers of management overhead: knowledge capture, management, and transfer.\n6. Spend 90 minutes in deep discussion w/ help from a multimedia tool like Miro.\n7. Spend 10m closing, ESPECIALLY getting real-time feedback via a \"fist-to-five\": ask attendees to put up a fist (complete waste of time) to five fingers (great use of time) and ask outliers why they didn't rate it lower OR what it would take to rate higher. This gut-driven information is GOLD. Use those insights to continuously improve meetings and surface insights that would otherwise be left unsaid.\n8. Leave 10m of buffer so attendees can break and prepare for their next engagement.\n9. Publish the recording, a transcript (that any team member can add comments to for async discussion of pertinent topics), and AI-generated summary (h/t Scribbl) to a public Slack/Teams channel.\n\"\nIf you stick to these, I GUARANTEE you'll start getting better results. And as leaders are expected to deliver better outcomes with leaner teams, human capital–efficient results matter more than ever.\n\"\nAny other remote team meeting tips?\n\"\nAdd one in the comments below! 👇\n\"\n\"#management #remoteworking #AI #meetings #digital",

    "content": "While there's a lot of excitement about #AI, there's also a lot concern that AI could quickly become an existential risk 😮\"\n\"\nAt the root of these concerns is the \"AI alignment problem.\n\"\nHow can we ensure that the recommendations and information AI presents us with is aligned with our best interests?\n\"\nI'd argue that the flip side of the anxiety about this problem—the potential upside of \"human-aligned AI\"—deserves more attention.\n\"\nWhat might this better future actually look like, and what does it mean for knowledge workers and their teams?\n\"\nWell, I hate to break it to you, but we already have an alignment problem (see the first image attached to this post): Advertisers and individuals go to mostly the same centralized \"digital watering holes\" for information. These systems are optimized for keeping users engaged by providing them with just enough value that they can slip in information that serves the ends of third parties.\n\"\nFor example, when you go to Google or YouTube with a particular goal (image 2), you will inevitably be tempted by third party–aligned content to go off-track, costing you valuable time and attention.\n\"\nNow, imagine instead if every single one of us has our own trustworthy, individual-aligned AI that accelerated progress toward our particular goal (image 3). It would protect our attention from distractions and serve us information that was likely to bring us closer toward our objective.\n\"\nPractically, the content that you'd be served in your digital news feed or search results would be prioritized according to the likelihood that it helps you achieve your current task, while ALSO being aligned with your longer-term goal. This is a subtle, but huge shift in how we might interface with the digital world.\n\"\nYou could scale this up to remote-native, globally distributed organizations (image 4), where—while you're \"on the clock\"—the information you're served is aligned with the organization's goal. This would reduce management overhead dramatically by driving down the costs of knowledge capture, sharing, and personalized communication between team members.\n\"\nPractically, how might this be implemented?\n\"\nWith the following ingredients:\n1. A loss function: say, mission-aligned #OKRs with weekly confidence scores (which requires individual agency and long-term thinking!) and\n2. A high-fidelity, self-sovereign digital repository of your life: I'd imagine some combination of a GPU-enhanced #Urbit server for storage + compute, Rewind AI for continuous data capture, and Apple hardware, e.g., the forthcoming #AR product line.\n\"\nIn a world where everyone has access to this new human-aligned personal computing stack, we'd finally be able to achieve Steve Jobs's original vision of the \"bicycle for the mind,\" freeing up our invaluable attention for investment in activities that make us MORE HUMAN: those of creation, relation, and contemplation.\n\"\n\"#technology #innovation #machinelearning #management #remoteworking",

    "content": "What can entrepreneurs learn from Medieval theologian St. Thomas Aquinas about customer discovery and prospecting?\"\n\"\nAs it turns out, quite a bit...\n\"\nIn the 13th century, St. Thomas defined love as \"nothing else than the willing of the good of the thing loved.\n\"\nThis is quite different than the popular, modern concepts of love, which tend to be more psychological or emotional.\n\"\nTo St. Thomas, \"to love\" was an act of the will, independent of the passions; and this act would have to also move the beloved in the \"direction of the good.\n\"\nIn startup terms, one might understand this as \"prioritizing customer needs,\" which, when unmet, present opportunities for entrepreneurs to use technology or expertise to remove limiting factors between customers and their desired future state (\"the good\").\n\"\nOf course, the entrepreneur (or salesperson) has his or her own goals, BUT by adopting adopting an ethos of love per St. Thomas's definition before entering a customer discovery interview or discussion with a prospect, he or she will get much better results in the long-term.\n\"\nIn doing so, it subtly changes the nature of the interaction in the following way:\n1. The interviewer is PRIMARILY focused on identifying, articulating, and—given that he or she has the means—solving the problems keeping the interviewee from achieving his or her goal(s) and\n2. The interviewer's own goal (e.g., to close a customer, to acquire information or a referral) transforms into a set of constraints (resources, know-how, etc.), which may or may not allow them to deliver an effective solution.\n\"\nThis leads to:\n1. A better understanding of the target persona (and the nature of the obstacles they face, some of which they may not have every fully articulated before), which grows stronger with each subsequent discovery interview;\n2. A more effective qualification process; and\n3. A process that creates authentic trust (an invaluable asset that never appears on a balance sheet...) between the interviewer and the interviewee by diminishing \"self-orientation,\" the denominator in Charles H. Green, David Maister, and Rob Galford's Trust Equation (see: https://lnkd.in/g84R6qFr).\n\"\nSO, the next time you're doing a round of customer discovery interviews or speaking with a prospect for the first time, consider taking a page from the Summa and bringing some Thomistic love into the conversation.\n\"\nYou might be surprised by what happens next...\n\"\n\"#startups #customerdiscovery #prospecting",

    "date": "2022-11-28",
    "content": "When it comes to OKRs, I’m generally a stickler for the rules.\"\n\"\nBut there’s one rule that I often break (and often recommend clients do the same)…\n\"\nIt’s that key results should be independent and uncorrelated.\n\"\nNow, at first glance, this rule makes a ton of sense. Ideally you only have 1x objective and 3x key results for your whole company (yes, even if you have 100+ employees), which means that you need to be extremely information-efficient with your key results.\n\"\nHere’s an example scenario (based on a VC-backed MedTech sales team I worked with): The team has identified an untapped segment (mid-market community health centers that generate a certain range of volume for a certain procedure every year) that they need to focus all of their energy on serving extremely well to create a market wedge and generate outsized leverage for the year ahead.\n\"\nOf course, the ultimate outcome the team wants to achieve is $ in revenue, BUT because the sales cycles can take longer than a quarter, they needed to figure out how to measure proxy outcomes toward that longer-term end that they could meaningfully effect in 3 months.\n\"\nThese were:\n- demos given\n- first contacts with new prospects\n\"\nNow, these two results are highly correlated, so with a “traditional” approach to OKRs you should only pick 1. However, because “demos given” is a lagging indicator (and it was a new segment), we decided to include “first contacts” as well. (There was a third result that measured the team’s ability to find one “super fan” customer, too.)\n\"\nAnd it worked fantastically. The team knocked it out of the park and dominated the new market segment.\n\"\nWhy?\n\"\nBecause the two results, while correlated in “information space,” were not correlated in time.\n\"\nIt’s what I refer to as a “vital outcome” and “quality input” KR combo.\n\"\nAt the first few weekly syncs, there wasn’t enough new information in re “demos given” to confidently make tactical changes, so the team instead focused on pulling the levers for “first contact,” which led to the lagging outcomes and generated insights, used to affect ALL outcomes.\n\"\nThis intense focus on reliably achieving a proximal outcome (really a quality input toward the vital, longer-term outcome) created momentum that led the team to achieve something they didn’t know was possible in such a short period of time.\n\"\nSo, next time you’re setting OKRs—especially on the “frontier”—consider breaking the “independent KR” rule by pairing a quality leading indicator with a vital lagging indicator, thereby allowing your team to strike a balance between high-agency action and long-term thinking that helps them do incredible things.\n\"\n\"#okrs #management #strategy",

    "date": "2022-11-23",
    "content": "Let's talk about \"status update hell\": what it is, why you're there, and how to get out...\"\n\"\nIt's a Tuesday morning at 10am. You chug a cup of coffee and hop on Zoom for the recurring weekly \"team sync\" meeting. It's supposed to go for 60 minutes but usually lasts 90. There are 9 other attendees. Their eyes track from left-to-right for most of the meeting; they are reading email and scanning Slack threads while speakers rattle off a laundry list of last week's to-do's. Someone screen shares a project tracker. The status flags are green. There are no questions—only statements. Your gut tells you that the company is not on the right track. But there's no cell in the status spreadsheet for your \"gut feeling,\" so you stay quiet.\n\"\nI have bad news: you are in the 8th circle of status update hell.\n\"\nWe all know that regular team syncs are critical—especially for remote teams—and, yet, these meetings too often devolve into rote performances of minimal substance. (And they cost $$$, especially at the exec level.)\n\"\nThis is usually because there's not a unified, medium–long-term objective anchoring the discussion. When that common end is unclear, attendees will understandably revert to sharing information relevant to their own personal objectives, which may or may not be aligned with those of the broader team, let alone the company.\n\"\nThe good news is that there's a way out—all you need to do is make a few simple tweaks*:\n\"\n1. Anchor the entire meeting with a common, unified goal, e.g., 1 objective & 3 key results.\n2. Assign a \"steward\" for each key result. This person is responsible for sharing a single confidence score at the beginning of each meeting (0–100%) that the result will be achieved by the end of the quarter. Note that the stewards are not responsible for achieving the results, only acting as \"nerve centers\" that can aggregate the relevant information each week into gut-driven scores.\n3. Rank the key results according to the gap between last week's confidence score and this week's. A gap means something changed, which means there are insights to be mined, shared, and possibly exploited in the coming week.\n4. Ask the group two sequential questions: \"Why the change?\" and \"What might we do this week to turn X% into 90%?\n\"\nIn adopting this meeting format, you've implemented a filtering mechanism that selects for vital information—information that moves the team closer to its long-term goal.\n\"\nThis means that there will be meetings where only a single key result is discussed. This is not only OK, but a desirable outcome—the attendees' valuable attention will be invested in the cognitively taxing and high-leverage tasks of developing causal models to make sense of the changes and generating creative hypotheses that you can test in the week ahead.\n\"\nTo get out of status update hell, maintain focus on what's vital!\n\"\n\"*\"simple, but difficult\" as Christina Wodtke says in \"Radical Focus,\" the BEST book on #OKRs and the source of the confidence score approach",

BUT there's no one-size-fits-all approach to learning. \"How\" you learn is a function of \"where\" you are.\n\"\nAs researchers Dave Snowden and Simon Wardley have pointed out, an approach to problem-solving and management that works great in one problem space or product development stage may fail or be counterproductive at another. For example, an early stage startup team probably shouldn't be using Six Sigma.\n\"\nOne way of thinking about \"where\" you are is to use a mental model derived from Donald Rumsfeld's 2002 statement, \"there are known knowns...\n\"\nImagine a 2x2 with two axes that run from unknown to known.\n\"\nTo learn is to move information into the \"known known\" quadrant from all others. But how you do that depends on the starting quadrant.\n\"\nThe \"unknown unknown\" is the frontier. It's dangerous. Operating there is risky, but also rewarding. When you set a good quarterly goal, you'll end up spending at least some time here—and whatever insights you gain can be transformed into an information edge and/or competitive advantage.\n\"\nWhen you known you don't know something you can do one of two things: either run experiments to tease out causal relationships or consult experts who know the things you know you don't.\n\"\nSometimes, you discover insights in the rather odd \"unknown known\" quadrant. These are the superpowers your team didn't know they had—an information edge that you weren't leveraging before. Individual strength/personality assessments can be great sources of these: Gallup StrengthsFinder, Luke Burgis's MCODE, or Crystal Knows.\n\"\nOnce you've moved information into the \"known known\" quadrant, you can \"compress\" it into a new technology, product, or process that makes it easy for others to use it.\n\"\nKnown knowns\" are fleeting (hence the infamous nature of the Rumsfeld quote), and your routinized model will need to be fixed, updated, or scrapped—it all depends on whether info gained from additional experimentation and expert consultation can account for the anomaly.\n\"\nOther times, a \"known known\" melds with the organizational culture in such a deep way that it can't really be codified and so becomes an \"unknown known.\" Oddly enough, this becomes a source of market power (Hamilton Helmer's \"process power\") because no single person can replicate it elsewhere.\n\"\nBy taking periodic snapshots of the evolving landscape of things you know, things you don't, and everything in between, entrepreneurs & innovators make better decisions and develop sound strategy with a Socratic ethos: \"I know that I know nothing.\n\"\n\"#innovation #learning #management #strategy #OKRs",

    "content": "When you’re managing a remote team, high-quality one-on-ones are critical.\"\n\"\nWhen done well, they complement your weekly cross-functional team meetings. You don’t have over-engineer them, but a little structure will go a long way.\n\"\nHere’s a simple approach you can use to make the most of that time and keep your team on track:\n\"\nFirst, schedule a recurring weekly 60–90-minute block with each of your direct reports (yes, I know this seems like a huge amount of time, but in order to surface valuable information, you’ll need to create sufficient space for insights to surface … 30 minutes is simply not enough to engage in the kind of discourse that unearths root causes … this pays off tremendously in the long run). I recommend doing it in the afternoon (1-4pm) so you can protect everyone’s high-quality attention in the morning, which can be invested into deep work.\n\"\nIf you have four directs, that means that 2-3:30pm M-Th let’s say is budgeted for 1:1s.\n\"\nThen, create a private shared doc (I prefer a Google doc) with two sections:\n1. A parking lot with bulleted topics to be attended to during the 1:1. If something comes up during the week (e.g., a “learning moment” opportunity after a poor interaction with a prospect or team mate), simply account for it in a single bullet so you can have a live discussion during the 1:1. I recommend keeping this list short - you’ll discuss 1–3 bullets during the 1:1.\n2. A table with 4 columns and three rows, where you’ll reflect monthly on performance expectations and identify opportunities for improvement. In the first column, identify the areas (one per row) that the employee is responsible for (e.g. “demand generation”) with a short, qualitative description of what they’re expected to achieve. In the second column, you will record your perception of the employee’s performance from 1-10. In third, the employee will use the same scale to rate themselves. Update this once per month and bridge gaps through dialog: first, those between your perception and the employee’s perception until you reach a shared rating; then, those between where they are and where they need to be (9/10, let’s say). This is an opportunity to get on the same page in terms of performance and identify activities they can use to improve performance (some of which will require investment on your or the company’s part).\n\"\nThis approach is both effective and efficient because it frames your conversations in terms of a simple formal structure (in alignment with the company’s goals) while leaving space for rapport building and deeper conversations that surface high-quality information.\n\"\nOne last tip: when you get the urge to make a statement or give direction, ask yourself if there’s a way to ask a question instead.\n\"\nWhat else can managers do to take 1:1s to the next level??\n\"\n\"Add your tips in the comments! 👇",

    "content": "Want to start developing a healthier relationship with social media?\"\n\"\nHere’s one weird trick you can use to put these attention-hungry platforms in your service…\n\"\nPrioritize production.\n\"\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\"\nWell, the way social media platforms (including LinkedIn) make money is, as most users are hopefully now aware, by selling your attention to advertisers.\n\"\nThe user experiences of these applications have been hyper engineered and fine-tuned for years—decades in some cases!—to grab and hold your attention.\n\"\nTherefore, users prioritize consumption by default.\n\"\nWhether or not you get real-world value from these platforms doesn’t really matter to social media companies, unless it’s in the service of keeping you glued to your feed.\n\"\nI’ve gotten a lot of value from social media: prospecting, learning, and bootstrapping real-world and mutually beneficial relationships with people around the world I’d otherwise never have met.\n\"\nBut none of that value came from doomscrolling.\n\"\nIt all was a function of prioritizing production: creating valuable content, sharing expertise for free, and contributing to conversations (not the same thing as being a low-effort “reply guy” for the record).\n\"\nHere are two things I do to prioritize production on social media:\n1. Batch all notifications into my daily summary: on iOS, you can do this in your notification settings. That way, I never check LinkedIn or Twitter out of boredom. I get a daily digest of messages to respond to that I can tackle efficiently with a batch process.\n2. Force myself to produce every time I open an app. If I’m going to allocate my attention to social media, I ensure that I’m treating that attention as an investment good rather than a consumption good. Practically, that means front-loading production. I don’t consume any content until I’ve first produced something I think will be valuable for folks in my network. Concretely, I’ve currently committed to one post and three comments before attending to anything else. If I can’t summon something, then I won’t dive in at all. This is tough, but it forces me to be much more discerning with where I’m putting my attention.\n\"\nIf you can commit to batching incoming messages and front loading all social media use with production, you will get 10x more value from every minute you give to the platform.\n\"\nIt’s tough, but totally worth it!\n\"\n\"Prioritize production—and just say no to doomscrolling.",

If someone feels like they can't trust the people around them (or, more saliently, the institutions upon which they depend), they will discount future rewards because they feel more uncertain about the future.\n\"\nTechnically, their \"time preference\" would increase, meaning they value what they can get in the present much more highly than what they could get in the future.\n\"\nHigher time preference is correlated with addictive behavior.\n\"\nThanks to social media (and pre-digital mass media, frankly) we're bombarded with visceral stories of gloom-and-doom that undermine our trust in institutions, each other, and optimism about the future. It's no wonder so many people are self-medicating (with analog AND digital drugs).\n\"\nAbout a year ago, I started making significant changes in my information diet, in part by restricting my own consumption of the global information feed—in time (I don't check messages until 1p Mon–Thurs) and \"space\" (I'm extremely particular about what feeds I'm subscribed to).\n\"\nIn less than a month, I noticed dramatic changes in my ability to focus on work that would yield long-term gains, endure long periods of discomfort, and general mood.\n\"\nI find myself naturally thinking in terms of long-term outcomes...how will what I'm doing today benefit me, my colleagues, my family, my friends, and my community a year from now? 10 years? A generation?\n\"\nThis has made it much easier to step out of the dopamine-hungry Twitter stream, turn off the TV, and enjoy all of the moments I get to experience—fully attentive—in reality.\n\"\nIf you want to feel better, consider taking measures to decrease your time preference by changing your digital environment.\n\"\n(And pick up \"Dopamine Nation\"!)\n\"\n\"https://lnkd.in/eesEGRgB",

    "content": "As we exit the COVID era, many are calling for a return to the office.\"\n\"\nWhile I’m sympathetic to the idea that certain types of work simply cannot be done remotely (I personally found the initial switch to remote work, excruciating), I have a hunch that those companies that were founded during the pandemic, and have committed to you a “remote native” foundation will be able to take advantage of certain technological trends and outperform their peers in the long run.\n\"\nWhy would that be?\n\"\nThe Internet continues to flatten the earth, and labor markets are becoming more liquid, especially as the next generation enters the workforce globally. Self-taught technical workers from developing nations are able to meaningfully compete for remote jobs, now able to disintermediate the outsourcing aggregators through which they would have had to sell their services during the 90s and 2000s.\n\"\nTo take advantage of this global liquid labor market, companies must find ways to reduce the cost of knowledge capture, management, and sharing.\n\"\nRight now, even the savviest remote teams spend altogether too much time writing and reading documentation. These labyrinths of notion pages in Google Docs, quickly go stale, and are “lossy”: much of what they contain is irrelevant to a new worker’s particular task or lacks critical information (aka “tacit knowledge”).\n\"\nI anticipate that every start up and large corporation will have their own artificial intelligence agent that employees will be able to query when they have a question, like a private Google.\n\"\nThat agent will respond to the same types of natural language quarries that an employee might ask his or her manager with exactly the information they need to do their work…\n\"\nThis, though, is contingent upon the continuous capture of information, especially tacit knowledge.\n\"\nThis is more easily done by remote teams who can record everything he gets discussed during meetings, on calls with prospect, etc. with the click of a button.\n\"\nIt’s an uncomfortable shift and requires tremendous trust, but if you’re able to get your team on board with “record by default,” I anticipate that you will generate a massive competitive edge in the next 2-5 years.\n\"\n\"Something for remote teams to consider! 📹",

Select “see all activity” and then tap and drag the bar chart right-to-left to see last week’s data.\n\"\nLook at “total screen time.”\n\"\nDivide that number by 100*. That’s approximately the percentage of your waking life you spent on your phone.\n\"\n(And if you’re tracking screen time on your laptop, too, it’s nearly a complete account of your time in the metaverse…)\n\"\nWhen I first do this exercise with clients, I let them soak in what they see and the ask, “How do you feel?”\n\"\nIt’s usually a mix of emotions: “well, I don’t like that I’m spending half of my life in front of a screen, but that is where work gets done…”\n\"\n“No problem,” I say. “There are reasonable limits on quantity—not interfering with sleep is a big one—but ultimately, the quality of your digital diet is most important.”\n\"\nNow, scroll down and look at the time spent in each application.\n\"\nThis is usually where the real discomfort sets in….\n\"\n“I spent 12 hours on YouTube/Candy Crush/Twitter last week?!”\n\"\nThe key here is tying your digital activities back to your real-world goals.\n\"\nThink about what it is that you want to accomplish in the next three months (OKRs are great for figuring this out).\n\"\nGo through each screen time line item and ask, “Did the hours I spent in this application serve that end?”\n\"\nIf the answer is not “absolutely—in fact I got way more out of it then I expected,” then you might want to consider making changes.\n\"\nYou can do this by:\n- deleting the app,\n- setting limits (screen time feature),\n- or (and this is where the real magic happens) meditate on what drew you to that app on the first place…what were you looking for, really, when you opened Instagram or surfed Substack newsletters? And are there other places you could go to get a much higher quality version of the thing you actually desire (practical business insights, human connection, novelty) at a lower cost (in terms of your attention)?\n\"\nWhy not, for example, purchase a book that contains an expert’s life’s work rather than spending tons of time sifting through unsatisfying blogspam written by marketers?\n\"\nDo this just once per week, make little tweaks in your information diet and digital behavior for next week, and keep yourself honest in re where you’re spending your attention versus your goals, and you WILL transform your relationship with your devices in 4–6 weeks.\n\"\nThere’s no way to get around the fact that facing reality is uncomfortable (painful, even).\n\"\nBut, if you can stomach this 10m/week investment, your present self will start thanking your past self for looking for your future self by keeping a clean digital conscience.\n\"\n\"*Although we’re awake for approximately 120 hours a week, you should apply a 20-hour discount to account for buffer between activities (2-3 hours per day of tx costs, eg commuting, chores, unforeseen obligations).",

Importance\n2. Urgency\n\"\nEvery incoming request was plotted on this 2x2, and, depending on which quadrant it landed on, the issue would be dealt with in a different way.\n\"\nIf an issue was urgent and important, Eisenhower would give it his attention right away.\n\"\nIf an issue was important but not urgent, he'd block time on his calendar to deal with it.\n\"\nIf an issue was urgent but not important (at least to him, meaning it didn't require his input), it would be delegated to someone else.\n\"\nIf an issue was neither important nor urgent, then it would never even come across his desk.\n\"\nThis system made running the White House—and leading the free world—manageable.\n\"\nThanks to the internet and our smartphones, all of us are now like Ike: we get bombarded with an unbelievable amount of information every day...a constant bombardment of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of mobile notifications vying for our attention!\n\"\nIt's incredible that any of us get anything done at all.\n\"\nThankfully, Apple rolled out a cool iPhone feature called the iMatrix to help us deal with information overload...\n\"\nActually it's called \"Notification Summary,\" and you can turn it on by going into notification settings on your iPhone.\n\"\nHere's how to get a handle on your notifications:\n1. Turn on Notification Summary (think of it like the morning/evening newspaper...it'll bundle all of the important/not urgent notifications into a tidy summary that you can tackle in batch)\n2. Toggle on notifications from all the apps that provide you with important but not urgent information (e.g., news, sports scores, social media updates)\n3. Go back into your notification settings and toggle off notifications for all apps that provide you with information that is neither important nor urgent (and consider deleting the app entirely if it doesn't serve you...your attention is too valuable to give away will nilly)\n4. Enjoy a more relaxed and focused state during the day because you can be confident that only information that is urgent AND important will penetrate the protective barrier between you and the virtual world, allowing you to get more done and focus on what really matters\n\"\nI did this almost a year ago and have never looked back!\n\"\nRegain your attention. Diminish distractions. Be like Ike.\n\"\n\"#iPhone #attention #work",

His syncretic experimentation is the basis for modern yoga-as-fitness.</p>\n\n<p>He was a \"fitness influencer\" over a century before Instagram. Sandow's fans sent him thousands of handwritten letters. His autobiography,&nbsp;<em>Strength and How to Obtain It</em>, includes a healthy sampling of those letters. Though stylistically different than posts you might read on an internet forum, these letters are eerily similar in content: from words of gratitude for the life-changing impact of his exercise routines to specific requests for expertise.</p>\n\n<p>I came across Sandow a few years back while perusing the Reddit community /r/fitness. One user asked:</p><blockquote>What does a highly trained NON-steroid body look like? With all the celebrities doing it 'naturally' but most likely supplementing to get their physique, I'm not sure what a clean result would look like. Anyone have any examples to separate Hollywood fiction from realistic fact?</blockquote><p>Another user pointed out that chemists didn't synthesize exogenous testosterone until 1935, so we can be confident that Sandow achieved his strength with neither protein nor pre-workout powders, let alone the hard stuff.</p>\n\n<p>This piqued my interest. The man was able to achieve what so many 21st-century fitness gurus promise and help other hopeful strongmen (and women) do the same. Per his wild popularity, commercial success, and the results contained in private letters from students and admirers—many of whom sent Sandow black-and-white photographs and columnated physique measures in a familiar before-and-after format—what he prescribed seemed to work. Moreover, his pupils achieved their results without expensive machinery, chemical enhancements, or any dazzling variety of fitness products such as those now hawked to us through late-night infomercials and social media advertisements.</p>\n\n<p>I read his autobiography cover-to-cover and was surprised to find that, despite my initial skepticism, it contained sound wisdom. His observations and prescriptions are relevant not only to fitness fanatics curious about the movement's early days but also to modern knowledge workers who want to achieve peak cognitive performance.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I learned:</p><ol><li>Exercise your mind.</li><li>Be moderate in all things.</li><li>Newer is not necessarily better.</li><li>Take cold baths. 🥶</li><li>To level up, work with an instructor.</li></ol><h2>Exercise your mind.</h2>\n\n<p>These are the opening lines of&nbsp;<em>Strength and How to Obtain It</em>&nbsp;(the emphasis is mine):</p><blockquote>Hundreds of letters reach me daily, asking, \"Can I become strong?\" Yes, you can all become strong&nbsp;<strong>if you have the will and use it in the right direction</strong>. But, in the first place,&nbsp;<strong>you must learn to exercise your mind</strong>. This first of all lessons in physical training is of the utmost importance. For on it the whole of my system depends.</blockquote><blockquote>If physical exercise alone and unaided could achieve the desired end, then would every one who, like the breaker of stones, has to use his muscles to earn his daily bread, become, in a popular acceptation of the term, 'a strong man.'&nbsp;<strong>The breaker of stones, however, never uses his mind.</strong>&nbsp;He has to get through a given amount of work, and his method is purely mechanical. Though he may use his muscles in hard work every day of the year it is unlikely that his strength will ever materially increase.</blockquote><blockquote>Exercise, indeed, without using the mind in conjunction with it, is of no use.&nbsp;<strong>It is the brain which develops the muscles.</strong>&nbsp;Physical exercise must be commenced by degrees, first bringing into play one muscle, then two, then three, and so on, being careful all the time to put the mind into every movement.</blockquote><p>How often have you opened your laptop and become an informational \"breaker of stones,\" tapping away on your keyboard against the textured auditory background of an infinite Spotify playlist (or the parasocial stimulation of podcast discourse), wading through a backlog of inane messages and semi-routinized tasks with the help of SaaS?</p>\n\n<p>Ask yourself, \"When was the last time I put real effort and thought into writing an email? Or invested more than five minutes into crafting a meeting agenda? Or gave my complete and unbroken attention to a colleague during a weekly Zoom one-on-one? Or really&nbsp;<em>listened</em>&nbsp;to a prospect, identifying gaps between content and micro-expressions, mining insights from the emotional content of the conversation and all that was left unsaid?\"</p>\n\n<p>Without undistracted (and right-sized) exertion, like those frustrated fans who sought written words of counsel from Sandow, your performance at work will plateau.</p>\n\n<p>In the long run, a preference for quality work products will yield better outcomes than a preference for the quantity of work products delivered. However, in this new work-from-home world of remote teams, it's more challenging than ever to direct your willpower on the basis of&nbsp;<em>quality</em>, thereby investing your brainpower into well-made information assets that yield compounding value. Distractions abound. It has become ever more tempting to prioritize urgent but unimportant tasks, their completion aided by charismatic software that simulates the feeling of flow.</p>\n\n<p>This is a trap.</p>\n\n<p>Like the gym rat who chugs a glass of neon pre-workout, turns the music pumping through his Airpods to 11, and spends an hour halfheartedly going through the motions of an exercise routine, the knowledge worker who avoids grueling discomfort by consistently prioritizing familiar tasks—tasks that give the worker a short-lived sense of relief—will soon find herself in a state of stagnation. Box-ticking, divorced from strategic considerations, requires energy but is unlikely to yield movement in the correct direction. It is even possible that individual performance might&nbsp;<em>decline</em>&nbsp;as repetitive dopaminergic loops lose their motivational power.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty soon, problems pile up and progress slows.</p>\n\n<p>When the ethos of quantity over quality—of more over better—infects company culture, vanity metrics begin to pilfer attention from key results; work becomes performative.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid this trap (at the gym and work), one should cultivate what meditation instructors call a \"beginner's mind,\" a recent label for a perennial aspiration (see, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-15.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mark 10:15</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Sandow writes, \"For the beginner the most difficult part of my system is so fully to concentrate his mind on his muscles as to get them absolutely under control.\"</p>\n\n<p>If you avoid the routinization trap, attenuate digital distractions, embrace discomfort, focus on that which is vital, cultivate a beginner's mind, and commit to prioritizing quality over quantity by exerting your will—as Sandow says, \"in the right direction\"—you will grow stronger, in both your physical and cognitive efforts.</p>\n\n<h2>Be moderate in all things.</h2>\n\n<p>What was the dietary secret to Sandow's success?</p>\n\n<p>Was he a paleo progenitor? A plant-based zealot? A carnivorous muscle man who declared a ketogenic holy war against simple carbohydrates?</p>\n\n<p>He was none of these.</p>\n\n<p>Sandow explains:</p><blockquote>It may be useful to remark that&nbsp;<strong>no particular form of diet was adopted</strong>. I ate and drank in the ordinary way. It may be said at once that I have no belief in special diet. There is no better guide to good living than moderation.&nbsp;<strong>Be moderate in all things</strong>, and you need fear no interruption in gaining strength by my system of training.</blockquote><p>This is contrary to contemporary counsel regarding food—really, our obsession with dieting—which assumes that there is some magical, precise formula by which you may summon your desired physique.</p>\n\n<p>Sandow believed no such thing, and the soundness of his approach is self-evident.</p>\n\n<p>What did he know that we don't? Or, instead, what was he able to perceive that we do not?</p>\n\n<p>We've put much faith in heuristics, frameworks, and shortcuts in our hyper-digitized, hyper-distracted world. (In my opinion, this trend pre-dates personal computation and is closely related to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://davidgraeber.org/papers/anthropology-and-the-rise-of-the-professional-managerial-class/\" target=\"_blank\">rise of the PMC</a>.) Regarding food, dietary guidelines have morphed into ideologies—in the case of the paleo and vegan crowds, religions even.</p>\n\n<p>You see this in business as well. There now exist entire cottage industries dedicated to winning over converts to a particular managerial cargo cult: be it SAFe, EoS, OKRs, or some other acronym picked from the management framework cornucopia.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to advocacy for complicated systems that include lexica, rituals, and clergy, Sandow's advice is simple: \"be moderate.\"</p>\n\n<p>This advice is time-tested:&nbsp;<em>Temperance</em>&nbsp;is one of the four classical virtues.</p>\n\n<p>Managers, VC-backed founders, and knowledge workers of all stripes should meditate on Sandow's imperative. You slowly lose the forest for the trees when you become overly fixated on doing things a certain way. Once a particular method's formal description (be it a dietary regimen or a management framework's implementation sequence) becomes untethered from the original \"spirit\" of that method (its&nbsp;<em>essence</em>, its&nbsp;<em>raison d’être</em>), that recipe—once a catalyst for progress—transforms into an obstacle that hinders your pursuit of long-term goals.</p>\n\n<p>So, how does one prevent what was a growth factor in one context from becoming a limiting factor in another?</p>\n\n<p>Again, \"be moderate.\"</p>\n\n<p>Note, however, that the&nbsp;<em>moderate way of being</em>&nbsp;paradoxically requires an additional, ongoing investment of executive attention. You must give yourself regular time to reflect. I recommend one to three hours per week of pure contemplation. Don't write. Don't speak. Just think. During this period of solitude and silence, you might assess the effectiveness of the heuristics you've used to pursue your goals. Ask yourself hard questions and confront cold, hard facts.</p>\n\n<p>Are you getting good results? If not, why not? If so, how? Should you continue on this path? What would have to be true for you to become more confident in your current approach? Do you need to make tweaks? Or develop a bespoke method from first principles?</p>\n\n<p>With a disciplined approach to regular reflection, you will grow in temperance and begin to discover a method tailored to your needs that yields good results. At that point, heuristics lose their luster, and you develop an intuitive sense of how to get stuff done (or what to eat), unencumbered by counterproductive scrupulosity.</p>\n\n<h2>Newer is not necessarily better.</h2>\n\n<p>Sandow first became interested in physical culture at ten years old:</p><blockquote>My father took me with him to Italy, and in the art galleries of Rome and Florence I was struck with admiration for the finely developed forms of the sculptured figures of the athletes of old. I remember asking my father if people were as well developed in these modern times.</blockquote><blockquote>He pointed out that they were not…<strong>they knew nothing of the modern luxuries of civilization</strong>, and, besides their training and exercise, their muscles, in the ordinary course of daily life, were always being brought prominently into play.</blockquote><p>It should go without saying that \"new\" does not equal \"better\"; however, as knowledge workers, we have come to expect rapid change after decades of steady technological improvement in the world of networked personal computing. \"New\" and \"better\" have been somewhat correlated, although total factor productivity has not increased as much&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmuP8gsgWb8\" target=\"_blank\">as we might have hoped</a>, a problem that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2022/10/20/why-is-technology-not-producing-productivity-improvements/?sh=40074e370e83\" target=\"_blank\">has puzzled economists for quite a while</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The \"athletes of old\" that Sandow speaks of were \"well developed,\" at least in part because they lived an era of \"might is right,\" where productivity—and, in some cases, outright survival—was contingent upon physical strength.</p>\n\n<p>In modernity, the means of production were routinized and encoded into machinery, a cost-efficient substitute for human strength. Therefore, physical strength was no longer necessary for survival per se, although, as Sandow knew (and we know, evidenced by the sheer magnitude of the 21st-century fitness industry), it is still good. To become strong, Sandow and his peers had to go beyond the range of proximal economic activity and build strength elsewhere with discipline and rigor.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in 2022, many of our most cognitively demanding tasks can be done by computers. However, to stay sharp, one must cultivate discipline and invest unbroken attention into solving problems that are not only vital to the success of the organization but also sufficiently challenging. Without regular exercise, the mind will atrophy. And with the growing avalanche of SaaS software components to which we can (attempt to) delegate cognitive labor, it's entirely possible to slip into a static equilibrium whereby you fulfill the nominal obligations of your role with a repetitive stream of mindless clicking.</p>\n\n<p>Then there's the problem of \"productivity software.\" Many of these tools are like the expensive in-home workout equipment advertised on late-night cable TV. If your goal is truly to increase the quality of your work, assume that the latest digital tool receiving adulation from the Twitterati is most likely a distraction.</p>\n\n<p>Eugen Sandow didn't need a Bowflex. Isaac Newton didn't need a suite of interoperable PKM modules. Dostoevsky didn't use generative AI to achieve his target word count.</p>\n\n<p>Again, instead of optimizing for quantity (of emails sent to prospects, of SEO-optimized blog posts, of—<em>shudder</em>—<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/KLOC-thousands-of-lines-of-code\" target=\"_blank\">KLOC</a>), prioritize&nbsp;<em>quality</em>. Budget&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-work-discovery-crisis-resolution-how-get-out-wartime-ulstrup/\" target=\"_blank\">chunks of high-quality attention</a>&nbsp;you can invest into&nbsp;<strong>exercising your mind</strong>&nbsp;by taking on challenging problems, pushing through discomfort without interruption, and ultimately crafting excellent work products.</p>\n\n<h2>Take cold baths.</h2>\n\n<p>From <a target=\"_blank\">Wim Hof</a> to <a target=\"_blank\">Andrew Huberman</a>, cold water therapy has become a popular staple in high-performance routines recommended by wellness entrepreneurs and credible scientists.</p>\n\n<p>Eugen Sandow was ahead of his time. In 1897, he wrote:</p><blockquote>If the pupil is able to exercise the first thing every morning let me advise him, whilst the body is hot with the physical performance, to take a cold bath. It does not matter how much he may be perspiring; the cold bath will prove exceedingly beneficial.</blockquote><p>As cold baths are beneficial for aspiring strongmen, so are the metaphorical \"cold baths\" available to knowledge workers.</p>\n\n<p>They are:</p><ol><li>Making contact with customers on the front lines;</li><li>Stress-testing toy models (especially financial models) to assess your project's existential risks; and</li><li>Investing two hours of cross-functional team time quarterly into \"uncovering the truth\" regarding company performance over the past three months</li></ol><p>These exercises may have an effect similar to that of submerging yourself in a tub of ice water: Initial shock and discomfort subside, and you benefit from a level of sobriety and focus that improves your decision-making, both in the moment and once you've exited the tub.</p>\n\n<p>Periodic submersion is a prophylactic against magical thinking (e.g., that rational investors will accept free cash flows discounted into the 22nd century, that fixed costs do not matter, that your team's SaaS toy box is a substitute for sound strategic thinking).</p>\n\n<p>Hope may be a virtue, but it is not a strategy. To stay focused and grounded, it is essential that all knowledge workers—and executives especially—make regular (and sometimes bone-chilling) contact with reality.</p>\n\n<h3>Heading to the front</h3>\n\n<p>I was extremely fortunate to start my career at <a target=\"_blank\">Red Bull Media House</a>, where I supported marketing and media teams with measurement tools that helped our most creative employees understand which of their experiments attracted the most attention.</p>\n\n<p>North American HQ, located in beautiful Santa Monica, was not a typical work environment, to say the least: There was a skate ramp in the middle of the office. Celebrity athletes and musicians would stroll past our desks in the middle of the day, often on their way to the \"high-performance gym,\" a space outfitted with expensive technology used by scientists and sports psychologists to help some of the most creative and innovative individuals of our day push the boundaries of human ability (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-w2_nTnunc\" target=\"_blank\">skydive from space</a>).</p>\n\n<p>While the company's leadership intentionally made these spectacular (and capital-intensive) investments in marketing, company culture, and so forth, they also understood that it came with a risk of corporate employees becoming somewhat untethered from reality.</p>\n\n<p>Pampered knowledge workers like me participated in an annual tradition called \"BOGFO,\" which stands for \"back office goes front office.\" For five days of the year, we arrived at distribution facilities across Los Angeles County, where we did 10–14-hour ridealongs with the men and women responsible for generating the last-mile revenue that paid our salaries. Each morning, at the crack of dawn, we would hop into Red Bull branded trucks and accompany our colleagues on their routes, helping stock thousands of cans at myriad points-of-sale: from family-owned bodegas in the San Fernando Valley to downtown Los Angeles's hottest nightclubs to gas stations along the PCH, where film industry execs filled up G Wagons on their way home to Malibu.</p>\n\n<p>I found this profoundly sobering for two reasons:</p><ol><li>I spent most of my days at HQ in the world of the Platonic forms, thinking in abstract terms about \"awareness\" and \"reach\" and statistical methods that we could use to link video views to drink consumption. But these exercises only mattered so far as they were useful, and they were useful so far as the flesh-and-blood people with whom I was interacting (e.g., my host, the c-store owners to whom he was selling, the construction worker in the Home Depot checkout line deciding between Red Bull and Monster) were moved to fulfill, demand, and consume ever greater volumes of this psychically charged liquid gold.</li><li>I had never really considered how much I relied on the arduous work of other people throughout the company—especially our BOGFO hosts—to pay my monthly rent. At one point, while shivering in the refrigerated soft drink section of a 7-Eleven, I worked through some back-of-the-envelope math in an attempt to figure out just how many cans of Red Bull needed to be stocked (every single one by human hands) to cover a three-hour brainstorming session between myself and two software engineers. (Somewhere around 1,000, IIRC.) That meant that for every hour I spent musing about strategy and building wireframes, my host would have to spend at least as much time doing the hard work of moving physical goods. This realization increased my awareness of the great expense of my privileged position and, once I returned, decreased my tolerance for any time wasted back at HQ.</li></ol><h3>Stress-testing models</h3>\n\n<p>A charismatic mission & product vision can be so compelling that company stakeholders forget to list and test their assumptions, kicking the can down the road with rounds of financing and ever-grander claims about the distant future world for which they are laying the foundation.</p>\n\n<p>It takes tremendous talent to summon and harness this kind of energy, but it's equally important to acknowledge that—even in a superabundant world—individuals and teams are constrained, whether by time, money, talent, or (perhaps most importantly) market demand.</p>\n\n<p>For a founder to accomplish her mission and manifest her vision, certain things&nbsp;<em>must be true&nbsp;</em>(<a href=\"https://rogermartin.medium.com/what-would-have-to-be-true-83dac5bd2189\" target=\"_blank\">h/t to master strategist</a> <a target=\"_blank\">Roger Martin</a>). With that in mind, it is therefore the duty of every knowledge worker, no matter his or her role in the organization, to take responsibility for the strategic considerations at their level of concern, articulate answers to the question of \"What must be true?\", prioritize contingencies according to the risk of failure introduced to the common objective if they are false, and reduce the uncertainty surrounding those risks with resourceful experimentation.</p>\n\n<p>Founders, for example, can get started with a simple financial model, working backward from a desired end state through a series of critical questions:</p><ol><li>How much annual net income must you generate to grow into your target valuation? (This may be a function of your ambition or necessitated by your investors' investors' requisite returns.)</li><li>What are the requisite SGA & R&D fixed costs, including your market salary?</li><li>How much gross profit would you need to generate to cover SGA & R&D?</li><li>How much should you expect to spend on marketing to generate marginal gross profits? (A 1:3 ratio is a good benchmark.)</li><li>What profit margins should you expect to generate from your core offering? (Products, services, and software all yield different margins.)</li><li>How many units of your core offering must you deliver to cover your fixed costs?</li><li>What annual growth rate would you need to achieve to hit these revenue targets?</li></ol><p>Bonus points for asking, \"Why should you expect to generate and maintain any market power at all?\" There is a pervasive myth, propagated over the last two decades, that high-margin software businesses are necessarily durable (this myth has, through incredible feats of mental gymnastics, become inclusive of services businesses as well).</p>\n\n<p>Beware! Long-term market power is elusive.</p>\n\n<p>I am sympathetic to the idea that project outcomes are overly predetermined: Reality will or will not be receptive to the capital configuration necessary to manifest your vision. With that in mind, it behooves even (and especially) the most ambitious visionaries to acknowledge, articulate, and respect constraints—constraints one can encode into a coherent model and test before becoming overly committed to a capital-intensive course of action.</p>\n\n<h3>Reflecting quarterly</h3>\n\n<p>Outsized progress is a function of growth. Growth is a function of learning. Learning necessitates reflection.</p>\n\n<p>When I work with clients to help them get their companies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/okrs-stepping-stones-how-vc-backed-founders-can-get-more-ulstrup/\" target=\"_blank\">across the metaphorical foggy river</a>, I spend at least two hours every quarter with the executive team \"uncovering the truth\" regarding what the company did and did not accomplish in the context of their strategic intent.</p>\n\n<p>By focusing executive attention on probing the gaps between where they wanted to be and where they arrived (note that these gaps might be well beyond their targets, which is both an achievement&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;an opportunity to generate insights!), they surface privileged information that they can invest into the next evolutionary stage of the company's strategy.</p>\n\n<p>These actionable insights don't simply appear; they must be&nbsp;<em>unearthed</em>. And, like the aforementioned financial modeling exercise, it has the effect of splashing everyone's face with cold water, waking the team up to not only&nbsp;<em>what must be the case</em>&nbsp;but, after three months of experimentation,&nbsp;<em>what is the case</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>To level up, work with an instructor.</h2>\n\n<p>Sandow worked directly with pupils, many of whom attended his brick-and-mortar school. One of these pupils was Arthur Foulkes, who, in 1899, wrote in correspondence with Sandow:</p><blockquote>Your system has certainly done me a lot good and freshened me up…Attending the school obviates three defects in working by yourself:—</blockquote><blockquote>(i.) You learn—not merely exercises—but the way to do them.</blockquote><blockquote>(ii.) You get an instructor who knows his work, and keeps you at yours.</blockquote><blockquote>(iii.) You are stimulated by seeing others working in the same room.</blockquote><p>Sandow's strength-building system is simple. So, too, is the process of developing and implementing sound strategy. Team-wide, consistent production of high-quality knowledge work products—all aligned with the chief executives' strategic intent—is critical for company success. This approach requires rigor and discipline, which can be difficult to cultivate in an age of digital distraction.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to learn \"not merely exercises—but the way to do them\" and keep yourself accountable for improving your technique, I recommend working with an instructor.</p>\n\n<p>Like Sandow during his trip in Italy, I wondered why, despite our various technological advances, 21st-century knowledge workers aren't as focused as we could be; so, I began a long process of developing, testing, and iteratively improving my own methods for building and directing personal attention—all without chemical enhancement, save for a morning cup of coffee—and the collective attention of high-performing teams.</p>\n\n<p>With OKRs and attention management techniques, I now help VC-backed founders, executives, and chiefs-of-staff get hyper-focused, reduce management overhead, and make outsized progress toward their long-term goals.</p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in strengthening your mind, developing a sound strategy, and focusing your team's attention on what is vital for long-term success, consider signing up for a free consultation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gsdat.work/\" target=\"_blank\">You can book a time for us to chat here.</a></p> ",

    "content": "When I work with founders who want to regain their attention from digital distractions and break free from the chronic stress that accompanies a compulsive e-mail habit, I start by helping them make one simple change…\"\n\"\nIt’s to keep their screen-based devices out of their bedrooms.\n\"\nWhen you’re ready to start taking attention management seriously, this one change alone will yield more value than almost any other technique.\n\"\nBut, it is SO HARD.\n\"\nFor many (if not most) of us, the faint glow of our phone screens is the last thing we see at night and one of the first things we take in in the morning.\n\"\nGoing cold turkey can be brutally difficult.\n\"\nThat’s why I recommend easing the transition by placing two substitutes on your bedside table:\n1. An engaging book: This doesn’t have to be a “nutritious” tome. In fact, I recommend selecting something altogether “junky”—a juicy tabloid, a graphic novel, some pulp fiction. When you’re craving stimulating information, it’s easier to resist the urge to check your digital notifications or your favorite social media platform if you have physical media (literally) at hand that satisfies the underlying desire driving your behavior.\n2. A notebook + expensive pen: If you’re not in a pure “consumption” mood, you might instead benefit from focused production. Journaling can be useful and, for some people, articulating their thoughts on paper may scratch this itch; however, I actually recommend using your bedtime notebook primarily as a doodle repository. Let your mind wander freely and see what emerges from the page—without the added pressure of restrictive language. Keep going until you’re asleep or the page is full with ornate details.\n\"\nWhat’s interesting about doodling is that it is an exercise in focused concentration, a foundational skill necessary to thrive in the 21st century.\n\"\nCompare that to, say, what you get from spending a commensurate amount of time scrolling on TikTok: the opposite—you fragment your attention in a mode of pure consumption, which has the effect of disrupting your sleep and degrading your ability to focus and do quality work the next day.\n\"\nWant to strengthen your mind and regain your attention from digital distractions?\n\"\n\"Give doodling a try this evening!",

    "date": "2022-11-01",
    "content": "Life is but a series of marshmallow tests.\"\n\"\nAnd we are awash in a sea of digital marshmallows...\n\"\nMany years ago, I came to the realization that delayed gratification was the key to happiness.\n\"\nWith each temptation that I resisted, I found myself becoming more calm, more focused, and more confident. It became easier to make good decisions, discern opportunities from distractions, and choose well. I have never since regretted taking a long-term perspective.\n\"\nIn the 90s, the average American found herself tempted by marshmallows made of atoms: As a college undergrad, for example, you could choose between studying for a final or drinking on frat row. Once you committed to holing yourself up in the library, the siren song of a night wasted (no pun intended) went silent. Your friends wouldn't even know where you were, let alone how to bother you.\n\"\nAs the ancients knew, it's never been easy for humans to make good decisions, BUT in the pre-digital world it was harder to make bad ones.\n\"\nOur choices were limited by local constraints in time and space; we were necessarily discerning. Every step you took required time, energy, and—if, say, you wanted to call a cab to head to that frat party—physical cash.\n\"\nBut now, making bad decisions is easier than ever.\n\"\nYou can order booze and burritos directly to your apartment. You can find charismatic bloggers and YouTube creators that reinforce your imprudent beliefs, gain your trust, and hawk their wares. You can access cheap credit with frictionless options to \"buy now and pay later\" at checkout. You can stream any particular selection of engaging (and, soon, immersive) digital content directly into your eyes and ears, substituting socialization, intimacy, and meaning with hyper-engineered simulations.\n\"\nAlthough these bad choices are somewhat limited to the world of bits, thereby mitigating catastrophic consequences, they are insidious and should carefully be avoided precisely for the same reason. Short-term errors compound, and without sufficient pain, there's no correction through learning.\n\"\nOn one hand, if you substitute an evening out for one of solitude, game-controller in hand, you don't run the risk of getting hit by a drunk driver.\n\"\nOn the other hand, while a Drizly-enhanced evening of Fortnite might leave you \"only\" with a hangover and a twang of embarrassment after purchasing a lavish digital item, that same activity (unlike the night out) is always at hand—literally a few button-pushes and swipes away.\n\"\nFeeling bored at \"work\" (you work at home)? Unhappy with the state of your social life? Feeling particularly rattled by warzone footage you came across on Twitter?\n\"\nJust eat a marshmallow.\n\"\nBecause we now have the ability to work, play, and socialize through digital media, it's easy drown in short-term satisfaction by scarfing down handfuls of mini-marshmallows throughout the day.\n\"\nThe next time you're tempted by a digital marshmallow, don't eat it.\n\"\n\"Your future self will thank you for it.",

Drastically.\n\"\nI shut off my laptop and phone strictly between the hours of 8pm and 8am every day. I unplugged completely on Sundays. I turned all of my screens to greyscale and deleted all social media apps (and then logged out of the web versions). I made the switch to Superhuman, kept my phone out of the bedroom, and waited to check my inbox (i.e., email, Discord, Slack, Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger) until 1pm every day.\n\"\nI eschewed podcasts and music during workouts. I even averted my eyes from cable news when I caught glimpses of it at the gym and in the kitchen.\n\"\nI spent a growing amount of time alone with my thoughts. And, man, was it painful (at first).\n\"\nI'd forgotten what it was like to be bored, a feeling of which I had vague memories: waiting for my parents to pick me up from elementary school, making my way through heats at a weekend swim meet, afternoons at the local library spent searching through book indices on a quest for information that I could write on paper notecards and turn into a research paper on Nepal.\n\"\nAfter about 10 tough days, I started noticing changes...\n\"\nTasks that I previously had zero interest in doing—from unloading the dishwasher to troubleshooting an issue with our home internet connection—suddenly became quite interesting.\n\"\nThose local problems that needed my attention were no longer competing with digital distractions, and I found myself actually ENJOYING doing chores around the house.\n\"\nNow, when I read or listen or watch, I slow down and absorb information, rather than inhale it. My sleep is immaculate. The quality of my thinking (and work product) is MUCH higher.\n\"\nI'm doing less, but better.\n\"\n\"Have you ever tried a digital detox? How did it go?",

We've outsourced daily decision-making and prioritization processes, in part, to interconnected software stacks that broadcast (often trivial, but always attention-grabbing) updates.\n\"\nComputers are always on, so we're now expected to be \"always on,\" too. This is not sustainable.\n\"\nNor should we ever have \"gamified\" work software.\n\"\nYour hammers and screwdrivers aren't yelling updates at you from across the room, so why do we tolerate constant distraction from our digital tools?\n\"\nUntil very recently, a LACK of information was the limiting factor that prevented organizations from quickly scaling.\n\"\nNow, there's so much that the limiting factor is unified focus — this starts at the highest levels with a coherent strategy (including what the company is NOT doing) and cascades all the way down to me and you.\n\"\nThat exhausting feeling of moving ever faster (but never faster enough) is a consequence of constant digital distraction.\n\"\nThe bad news is that protecting your attention is more difficult than ever (and only becoming more difficult).\n\"\nThe good news is you can do something about it—and start using your digital tools to get stuff done.\n\"\nBut how? There are so many productivity apps, YouTube tutorials, and more meditation subscription services than you can possibly imagine...\n\"\nCounterintuitively, you can reclaim your attention and get stuff done not by adding more to your \"productivity stack\"—but by doing LESS.\n\"\nHere are 3 things you can do today (& tomorrow) to start feeling more at ease:\n1. Turn your phone and computer on greyscale: Product designers and marketers use color to grab your attention. Neutralize their ability to distract by updating your machine's accessibility settings.\n2. Set hard limits on screen time: I shut down all of my devices between the hours of 8pm and 8am. Apple's \"downtime\" settings (in Screen Time on MacOS and iOS) are really helpful for this.\n3. Make yourself unreachable until 1pm once per week: This will help you get 1–3 90-minute cycles of morning deep work done. You'll be shocked by what you'll accomplish.\n\"\nWhat else would you put on this list?\n\"\n\"Comment below 👇",

It’s time to learn how to do more with less.</p></blockquote><p>Although recent rate hikes have spooked some investors (and growth+ stage tech companies have gotten crushed), they’re unlikely to impact early-stage financing for at least a few years.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, that relieves some anxiety for early-stage founders who think equity financing is the right path.</p>\n\n<p>However, it also means that later-stage investors (including public market participants) will be less tolerant of traditional tech 10x+ P/E valuations commanded by startups that aren’t purely technology companies. As a result, the era of VC-backed “tech-enabled” services businesses is waning.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the end of a 14-year run that began with Uber, was fueled by infinite QE post-2008, and reached its peak sometime around the unsuccessful WeWork IPO.</p>\n\n<p>Although there’s a lot of “dry powder” ready to be deployed, earlier-stage investors may be hesitant to invest in your startup if your DCF model disappears off into the horizon; it will be difficult for them to convince fund GPs at higher rungs of the equity financing ladder to purchase shares at the requisite price.</p>\n\n<p>This is something that I didn’t fully appreciate before diving headfirst into the startup world: Although, yes, professional investors will always care about fundamental company quality, when they listen to your pitch, they’re also trying to calculate the odds that they’ll be able to sell what you’re selling to their prospects (Series A to B, B to C, etc.) and quickly.</p>\n\n<p>In the years ahead, the bars for each successive round of startup financing will be higher than at any time in the last decade.</p>\n\n<p>In parallel, customer acquisition costs will continue to rise thanks to Apple’s war with Meta, which has put upward pressure on ROAS (return on ad spend) hurdle rates.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the startups that survive will be the ones that generate more profit, sooner.</p>\n\n<p>Practically, entrepreneurs must figure out how to do more with less. More profit with less capital. More effective campaigns with less marketing spend. More value delivered to customers in fewer product release cycles.</p>\n\n<p>To survive (and thrive), founders will need to make deeper, narrower, more precise bets. And the kind of decision-making that&nbsp;<em>works</em>&nbsp;in this more resource-constrained environment necessitates a rigorous approach to strategy and company management that gets teams hyper-focused, aligned, and free of the distractions that were more tolerable when money was cheap.</p>\n\n<p>Cash will always be king. But financing will no longer eclipse operations.</p>\n\n<p>The 0% interest rate reign is over.</p>\n\n<h3>What should you do about it?</h3>\n\n<p>Get focused. Take strategy seriously. Set ambitious LTV/CAC goals. Don't abandon your grand vision, BUT make contact with reality as soon (and as often) as you can.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t count on getting VC financing if your offering isn’t a good fit (i.e., pure tech) or before you’re ready.</p>\n\n<p>And once you do start raising (pre-seed, seed, A), consider proactively implementing a goal-setting framework like&nbsp;<strong>OKRs</strong>&nbsp;before you realize you need it.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, you’ll spend months (and a good chunk of your investors’ money) learning the hard way that the approach that got you from 0 to 1 doesn’t work as well at the next level of the game.</p>\n\n<p>You can read about how OKRs can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/okrs-stepping-stones-how-vc-backed-founders-can-get-more-ulstrup/\" target=\"_blank\">fit into your existing startup journey here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And if you’re serious about using OKRs to get stuff done but first want some expert advice, I’m always&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gsdat.work/\" target=\"_blank\">available for a free consult</a>.</p> ",

New hires are eager to help, but collectively aren't moving the needle as much as VC money necessitates. The founders realize that how they were running the startup in the early days does not scale.</p></li><li><p>One of their investors (or another founder) tells them to try OKRs.</p></li><li><p>The CEO skims a few blog posts on OKRs or a book like&nbsp;<em>Measure What Matters.</em></p></li><li><p>Execs spend a day or two creating a bunch of objectives and key results, which are handed off to lieutenants to implement with their respective teams.</p></li><li><p>Months pass.</p></li><li><p>It doesn't \"feel\" like the OKRs are doing anything (and, TBH, everyone has forgotten what the OKRs were).</p></li><li><p>A chunk of the investors' money is gone.</p></li><li><p>The founders start getting anxious because it feels like they're working harder than ever but not making enough progress, and they're not quite sure why.</p></li><li><p>Someone close to the CEO (their chief-of-staff, an advisor, or a biz ops lead) will start pinging private chat groups and MBA program alums, asking for help.</p></li><li><p>I'll get connected, learn more about the specific situation, and help them make the right changes.</p></li></ol><p>Although every business is different, I've found that there's usually one common problem we need to address before we dig into templates or schedule workshops.</p>\n\n<h3>What's the problem?</h3>\n\n<p>The leadership team didn't understand how OKRs fit into their journey before trying to use them.</p>\n\n<p>The \"paint-by-numbers\" approach to OKRs is straightforward enough. But unless you first understand the \"spirit\" of OKRs and how they fit into your existing map of startup reality, they're unlikely to stick.</p>\n\n<p>That's why—before anyone sticks a single post-it to a whiteboard—I share a metaphor:</p><blockquote><p>Building a startup is like crossing a foggy river to get to the top of a hill on the other side.</p></blockquote><p>You start your entrepreneurial journey on a riverbank, gazing across the water at your ultimate destination: an unoccupied plot of land at the top of a hill where you'll build a world-changing, value-creating institution that will last generations.</p><figure><img data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQFv7gblMDKpcg\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFv7gblMDKpcg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1666372521760?e=1744848000&v=beta&t=IPEx-a1e3F30PjDrzP1G2lHJmLCAHwAxyQIyQ-JtN60\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Like a compass that points north, the direction of that ultimate destination (no matter where you find yourself during customer discovery, pacing up and down the shoreline) is your&nbsp;<em>mission</em>. The future reality on top of the hill is your&nbsp;<em>vision</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Your mission and vision remain relatively fixed. Maybe once a year, you rise above the startup chaos and check if you're still in alignment.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the challenge: to get to the other side—to achieve your mission and manifest your vision—you need to cross the river. And the river is covered in a thick layer of fog. So the shortest path from where you are to where you ultimately want to go is&nbsp;<em>radically unknown</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But just a few feet ahead of you, if you squint hard, you can see a few flat rocks poking out of the water. You have a strong hunch that beyond some of those proximal stepping stones are other stepping stones, and if you take the proper steps forward, you will be able to cross the river and achieve great success.</p><figure><img data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQFBNlLk1K8eyA\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFBNlLk1K8eyA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1666372552457?e=1744848000&v=beta&t=aU-PBxzSrMXdbu2Z5kFAYbkdNVVqDusfIW56PXUjYPM\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Those big stepping stones you can barely see, right at the edge of the fog, are possible&nbsp;<em>objectives and key results</em>. They're close enough that you can perceive them but far enough away that you can only step towards one at a time: No matter which stone you choose, it'll take about three months (one quarter) to get there.</p>\n\n<p>You've got food in your satchel (capital in your bank account) and an unfinished river map (internal knowledge base).</p>\n\n<p>You try to get closer to your ultimate goal with every step. At the very least, you dispel the fog and explore the dark spots on the map.</p>\n\n<p>Through this process, you discover two types of unexpected&nbsp;<em>insights</em>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Limiting factors</strong>&nbsp;that prevent you from making additional progress (e.g., a competitor who turns out to have an exclusive distribution deal with a prospective channel partner) and</p></li><li><p><strong>Growth factors&nbsp;</strong>you can leverage to accelerate forward motion (e.g., an unanticipated customer need for which your proprietary tech is the perfect solution).</p></li></ol><p>Every quarter, you take stock of these insights and exploit them to take bigger and better steps forward. You direct your limited energy toward removing limiting factors and catalyzing growth factors. These insights compound, giving you an information edge, difficult for incumbents and competitors to replicate.</p>\n\n<p>Your teammates are like cells in your body (it's no coincidence that the root of \"corporation\" means \"body\"). With scale, they specialize in a departmental structure (organs) with restricted fields of view. The chief executive needs to synchronize these components with his or her strategic intent.</p>\n\n<p>The executive team can achieve synchronization by orienting components toward two aligned ends:</p><ul><li><p>The company's long-term mission + vision and</p></li><li><p>1x shorter-term objective and 3x key results.</p></li></ul><p>Without those unifying ends, the team's motion will be \"stochastic\" or \"Brownian,\" i.e., lots of&nbsp;<em>work</em>&nbsp;but little&nbsp;<em>movement</em>&nbsp;in the right direction.

    "date": "2022-09-09",
    "content": " <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4E12AQEo-igH-mOMyw\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"> <p>In retrospect, it was inevitable. The internet—which was supposed to make us more connected—has loosened the informational ties that bound us together in the 20th century.</p>\n\n<p>With unmediated access to source material and near-zero publication costs, digital media has had the effect of both illuminating the truth and blinding us to it.</p>\n\n<p>For millennia, human beings gazed upon a reliable night sky and constructed a library of constellations. Upon (or from) the signs of the zodiac came stories that everyone could agree upon; these narratives contained a sufficient degree of objective truth, some practical knowledge, and social glue that would bind communities with a common mythos.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in the 20th century, professional academics and other epistemic intermediaries gazed upon primary sources and constructed constellations of history (connected to the present via the news).</p>\n\n<p>The proliferation of internet access has “lit up the informational night sky,” allowing every individual to gaze upon a vast sea of digital data and construct his own constellations. There are benefits: Discoveries on the frontier of human knowledge, illumination of previously dark spots on the map of reality, and an unprecedented ability for individuals to speak truth to power. We are in an era where, in the long run, power will find it difficult to conceal itself. This is good.</p>\n\n<p>But, there are also significant downsides: With the number of “stars in the sky” increasing at an accelerating pace, we can more easily string together data to support an imaginal construct. This widespread activity is rather unsurprising in a postmodern world, where a healthy skepticism of power taken to the extreme leaves atomized postmodern man with the raw material and technology to construct a self-centered metanarrative, a high-fidelity and (perhaps most insidiously) internally consistent Zodiacal “mythos of me.”</p>\n\n<p>Something analogous happened in the 16th century with the printing press and the Protestant Reformation. And then, just as now, unmediated access to source material often yielded value. But it also caused European society to fracture violently and allowed individuals, blinded by new information (and pride), to introduce and propagate errors.</p>\n\n<p>Conspiratorial thinking is nothing new. It’s a perennial human activity (in the west, antisemitic conspiracy theorizing in particular: see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/martin-luther-quot-the-jews-and-their-lies-quot\" target=\"_blank\">Luther</a>&nbsp;500 years ago or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism\" target=\"_blank\">Marcion</a>&nbsp;and various&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Gnosticism\" target=\"_blank\">other Gnostics</a>&nbsp;2000 years ago). We can’t help ourselves but connect the dots. Now, there are so many dots that we can—emboldened by a culture that does not take objective reality very seriously—construct whatever pictures we want.</p>\n\n<p>The typical postmodern internet conspiracy theorist makes a critical error regarding his primary motivation: He claims to pursue the truth. Often, the subtler aim—one to which we are all susceptible—is to feed his ego with a self-impressed narrative that demonstrates how smart and enlightened he is, especially compared to the stupid masses of sheep. This error is compounded further by three factors:</p><ol><li>The difficulty of discerning the imaginal from the real in cyberspace,</li><li>Insufficient contact with reality, and</li><li>The refusal of traditional epistemic elites to acknowledge nuggets of truth contained within the conspiracy theory.</li></ol><p>From my limited understanding of psychological warfare, the standard approach to combating conspiratorial projects is to flood the information sphere with noise or attempt to shape narratives from within through infiltration. While this may be effective in the short term (and I understand why there would be practical reasons to take this approach in “war time“), it is insufficient in the long run. Instead, those in power who genuinely care about the good should commit to taking objective reality seriously again by:</p><ol><li>Dedicating institutional resources to the dissemination of the truth, no matter how painful or embarrassing acts of public revelation might be to elites and statesmen who have committed errors, and</li><li>Arming the next generation, through technology-enabled public education, with tools for critical thinking (“how to think,” not doctrinal declarations of “what to think”).</li></ol><p>If we want to preserve our institutions—and we absolutely should—then we must abandon the postmodern project and start taking reality seriously. Through that (painful) process, every single one of us will be able to raise our eyes toward the same night sky, one further illuminated by bright new points visible through the great gifts afforded to us by the miracles of networked personal computing technology, and a behold a common view of reality as it actually is—and with unprecedented clarity.</p>\n\n<p>The truth has always, does, and will always set us free.

While many executives and other knowledge workers are familiar with the term—and perhaps the praxis of deep work—few have incorporated it into their routines. Given the evidence for deep work’s goodness, the widespread availability of deep work “how-to’s,” the lip service paid to it by managers, and the fact that the digital age makes this more feasible than ever, the fact that it remains a rare phenomenon in the wild is rather odd.</p>\n\n<p>What explains this?</p>\n\n<p>I have sometimes found that when I present deep work as a concept to clients, friends, and colleagues, they generally like the sound of it. But when they realize the changes in their habits and routines it would necessitate, they begin to find the concept impractical (or even offensive).</p>\n\n<p>Some common objections:</p><ol><li><strong>“It’s not for me.”</strong>&nbsp;That’s true as long as you believe it.</li><li><strong>“There’s no way I could make four hours of uninterrupted deep work time in a single day, let alone four days a week. I have to be online available and urgently responding to incoming requests.”</strong>&nbsp;Unless you’re a salesperson or customer service representative, this is likely a self-imposed limiting belief&nbsp;<a href=\"https://annehelen.substack.com/p/larping-your-job\" target=\"_blank\">reinforced by video games masquerading as corporate communication software</a>. Even if you are a customer service representative or a salesperson, you should still be able to make deep work&nbsp;<em>work</em>&nbsp;because you will inevitably discover value-adding tasks that you can document and routinize.</li><li><strong>We are currently in crisis mode, i.e., “wartime.”</strong></li><li><strong>“I don’t even know what I should be doing during deep work time.”</strong></li></ol><p>Objections three and four are the subject of this essay.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that 3–4x 4-hour deep work chunks per week are the platonic ideal for digital market economy participants who care to thrive in the 21st century. During deep work time, you’re essentially investing in human capital–intensive assets and “developing bespoke technology” (this includes process design and does not need to be codified in machine language for it to be valuable). Asset (technology) development is the only moral way to create compounding value (which can accrue to you as a sole proprietor or the collective corporate entity to which you belong) and thus wealth. I am not aware of any alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>However, at a given time, whether you’re able to do deep work at all and the types of problems you should focus on are a function of your current environment. Particular limiting factors, which you can remove, are related to objections 3 and 4 above.</p>\n\n<p>To understand “where you are” (and thus what you can do about it), ask yourself the following questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Am I in wartime or peacetime?</strong></li><li>Do I know what I need to do, or <strong>have I wandered into a dark spot on the map?</strong></li></ol><h2>“We are in crisis mode…”</h2>\n\n<p>If it’s wartime, you must first “stop the bleeding”; then return to peacetime ASAP. Do this by putting structure around your work as quickly as possible. Tighten feedback loops between teammates. Introduce a sense of urgency into everything you do, especially the content and quality of your communication.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if there’s a system outage or one of your suppliers suddenly and unexpectedly went under, you need first to figure out how to fix the issues at hand. Spending four hours doing deep work would be irresponsible—<strong>you need to survive</strong>&nbsp;and then keep digging until you get to the root of the problem. That second part is critical if you want to return to and stay in peacetime. If, say, a recent update introduced a critical bug to your codebase, then, of course, the first thing you want to do is roll back the system to a previous version. But, you should also dedicate sufficient resources to understanding the root cause of the problem in the first place—not just in terms of code but also (and perhaps more importantly) regarding human errors and process failures. Once you’ve fixed those systemic and organizational issues, you’ll have a more durable foundation. On the other hand, if you don’t identify and address the underlying issues, you are almost guaranteed to find yourself in wartime again soon, or, worst case, your successors will suffer some catastrophic meltdown in the distant future.</p>\n\n<p>If it’s peacetime and you have the privilege and luxury of doing deep work up to four days per week, then you should protect that time and attention as much as possible and set yourself up for success. This is a pretty straightforward exercise: Figure out the 3 to 4 most excruciatingly difficult problems you need to solve or think you need to solve to make outsized progress towards your longer-term goals. Scope them to fit into four-hour chunks, come up with definitions of done, and then allocate them to days of the week. When you know what you need to work on daily, you should feel confident in your decision to hermetically seal your attention from any irrelevant interface with the digital world and focus on solving a local problem. If you don’t plan your mornings, you’ll always be left with doubt that you’re not working on the right thing, and you will likely become distracted during your deep work time.</p>\n\n<p>To maximize quality-of-attention during those hours, it is imperative that you get 7 to 9 hours of sleep the night before and not<em>&nbsp;commit the grave error&nbsp;</em>of checking email, Slack, or any other messaging service between the time you wake up and when you start your deep work. The goal is to be unreachable until ~1 pm on deep work days.</p>\n\n<h2>“I don’t even know what I should be doing…”</h2>\n\n<p>This could be true for a few different reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Unclear strategic direction.</strong>&nbsp;If the company mission, vision, and medium-term strategic direction are unclear, you may want to consider joining a different company. If the purpose-driven direction of your deep work is out of alignment with that of the company, then the effect of your labor will be blunted. If you’re not an executive, your options are to support execs in setting strategic direction, find a company that is in a state of clarity and alignment, or stake out on your own as an entrepreneur. The last path is probably the most difficult, but it does allow you to achieve the highest degree of alignment (and, thus, do the deepest deep work).</li><li><strong>The team’s objective is clear, but&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;to accomplish that objective is unclear.</strong>&nbsp;Deep work is a great way to get yourself out of this conundrum; however, instead of developing hardened technology towards a particular end (e.g., writing code), you should spend your deep work time designing and running experiments. For example, if you’re having issues generating demand, you might want to figure out novel ways to reach your prospects with new content and channels. As a general rule, the ideal deep work problem is one that no one has ever solved; short of that lofty ideal, it should at least be a problem you have never solved.</li><li><strong>You’re making significant progress, and you’ve found yourself in the enviable position of having a genuine surplus of time and attention.</strong>&nbsp;This is deep work time you should spend on research and development. Google’s famous 20% rule is a good benchmark for how much you should invest (note that that’s roughly equivalent to one day per 5-day work week). If you’ve wandered into the frontier of human knowledge, and what lies ahead of you is a dark spot on the map, this is an excellent opportunity to engage in undirected discovery and exploration. There is a fantastic book by Kenneth Stanley called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective/dp/3319155237\" target=\"_blank\">The Myth of the Objective</a>&nbsp;where he explains, through findings in machine learning research, that value on the frontier can be ascertained through a process of undirected discovery, driven by curiosity and a will-to-interestingness (in stark contrast to goal-driven progress). Instead of doing something in the context of a narrow and precise objective, you’re simply allowing yourself to become deeply curious and pursue ideas that are inexplicably interesting to you. In practice, perhaps on a Friday from 9 am to 1 pm, you read everything you possibly can about a topic related to your vocation that you’ve been curious about but haven’t had the time to explore. Or, you could pick up a new tool for the first time and get your first reps in. (If you’re a designer, for example, you might use this time to learn the nuances of a tool like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://midjourney.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Midjourney</a>* or DALLE-2 to create AI-generated concept art.)</li></ol><p>Establishing clear strategic direction, running experiments in a complex environment where the link between cause-and-effect is still tenuous, and undirected exploration are all valuable activities that fit into 4-hour “discovery” deep work chunks. Post-discovery, it becomes easier to scope deep work and pursue more precise goals.</p>\n\n<h2>OK, but why should I do this at all?</h2>\n\n<p>One of the best parts of incorporating deep work into your weekly routine is that it frees up a shocking amount of time and attention—attention that you can allocate towards meaningful non-work activities, say, in service to your family and community.</p>\n\n<p>Interested in learning more about deep work in the digital age?
