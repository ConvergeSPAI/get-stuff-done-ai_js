 <h2>The "Relocalization" of Software</h2>

<p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and consumer hardware is fundamentally changing how we interact with technology. While the client-server model and cloud-based software services have reigned supreme for years, we might soon witness a return to local environments powered by bespoke AI software.</p>

<p>Here's why:</p><ol><li><strong>Lower cost of AI-driven software development</strong>: AI now enables the creation of customized software at a fraction of the price, allowing users to get precisely what they need instead of relying on generic, mass-produced software.</li><li><strong>Powerful consumer hardware</strong>: Devices like smartphones and laptops are becoming increasingly powerful, with specialized hardware that supports running AI models locally.</li><li><strong>Underutilized consumer compute</strong>: Most consumer devices operate at 50% or less utilization, opening up opportunities for AI to carry out tasks, like research or networking, during idle times, like when you're asleep.</li><li><strong>Privacy and data protection</strong>: As digitization becomes the norm, privacy and data protection are more crucial than ever. Local software reduces the risk of data leakage compared to third-party services and APIs.</li><li><strong>Cost pressures</strong>: With economic challenges on the horizon, users (consumers and corporate) will seek cost-effective alternatives to cloud-based services, opting to run jobs with local computing resources and bespoke software to save money.</li></ol><p>However, the transition to local environments will not be uniform globally. Emerging markets will continue to benefit from cloud-based services like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/post/edit/7046821325889273856/?author=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAVulxsBFyr0EzPHwXppryACSci3VX4WxgQ#" target="_blank">Replit</a>, a cloud-native, AI-enhanced integrated development environment. Meanwhile, at the other extreme, Urbit's peer-to-peer model is baked into the operating system, allowing all software to be hosted and run by the client.</p>

<p>These different paradigms will coexist, butâ€”based on my recent experiences with GPT-generated code that I've elected to run locally and NOT in the cloudâ€”the shift away from the dominant client-server cloud-based software model of the last decade seems inevitable. I anticipate that "artisanal" software development will become a thing sooner than later.</p>

<h2>Artisanal Software ðŸ”œ Nocturnal AI Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Instead of searching for venture-backed software as a service (SaaS) companies on Product Hunt or Google, we will turn to AI-powered tools like ChatGPT to write code for local applications, providing greater control over software functionality and data access while keeping costs low. The era of cloud computing isn't coming to a sudden end, but it's facing a new, compelling alternative in local software environments.</p>

<p>In the years ahead, we could see a digital ecosystem emerge where AI running on your local machine interacts with other personal AIs and more powerful AIs like GPT-5. This interconnected web of intelligent agents could operate behind the scenes, maximizing the potential of your devices and working on your behalf.</p>

<p>Imagine this scenario: you have a personal AI running on your powerful laptop or smartphone, carrying out tasks while you sleep. Your AI searches the internet to gather information on a topic you're interested in, connects with other personal AIs to build your network, or even collaborates on a project. By the time you wake up, your to-do list is entirely different than when you went to sleep!</p>

<p>While your personal AI is highly capable, it may encounter situations where it needs the expertise of a more sophisticated, centralized AI like GPT-5. In such cases, it can securely transmit redacted or anonymized information to GPT-5, harnessing its vast knowledge and resources to tackle the problem. Then, your personal AI can integrate the insights and continue with its task.</p>

<p>This "nocturnal ecosystem" of invisible, intelligent agents could operate in parallel with our daily lives, enabling us to wake up to a wealth of new information, connections, or even completed tasks. As AI-powered tools become more prevalent and our devices more powerful, this interconnected web of local and cloud-based AI agents will work together to accomplish goals, optimize time, and offer users a seamless, customized experience.</p><figure class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQHAbR7qYDGn0w" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHAbR7qYDGn0w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1680095294514?e=1744848000&v=beta&t=Qss8XCvizeNUZQcFpSEzWybgIuARJOS9VN34Pa9-_FA"><figcaption><br>(to the tune of "All Night Long" by L. Ritchie): Well, my friends, the time has come / To raise the roof and have some fun / As we sleep, our AIs will play / In this hidden world they'll sway...</figcaption></figure><h2>Implications for Individuals and Businesses</h2>

<p>What does this mean for you?</p>

<p>Here's how professionals, from analysts to CIOs, can adapt and thrive in this changing landscape:</p><ol><li><strong>Embrace AI-powered tools</strong>: Leverage AI-driven software development tools to create bespoke solutions tailored to your unique needs. By doing so, you'll gain greater control over your software and data while reducing costs. Start by&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus" target="_blank">purchasing ChatGPT Plus</a>&nbsp;and asking GPT-4 to write code that solves your most proximal problem.</li><li><strong>Invest in powerful hardware</strong>: As consumer hardware becomes increasingly powerful, consider upgrading your devices to support AI models running locally. (Developers are&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ggerganov/status/1640416314773700608" target="_blank">already making incredible strides with LLaMA on MacOS</a>.)</li><li><strong>Stay agile and cost-effective</strong>: Evaluate your software choices and be open to more cost-effective alternativesâ€”especially AI-enabled "bespoke" solutions (e.g., local Python scripts). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7044834382477484034/" target="_blank">You can save money</a> by moving your workloads from the cloud or cloud-based SaaS.</li></ol><p>By understanding and adapting to these changes, you can stay ahead of the curve and optimize your software solutions for the future.
