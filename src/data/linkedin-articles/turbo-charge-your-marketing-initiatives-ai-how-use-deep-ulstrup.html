<p>You can use AI&nbsp;<em>today</em>&nbsp;to:</p><ol><li><strong>Accelerate market research</strong>&nbsp;by analyzing large, unstructured data sets (e.g., AI-transcribed podcast backlogs), saving time and money compared to traditional customer discovery interviews;</li><li><strong>Surface personalized insights</strong>&nbsp;relevant to your specific business goals, core competencies, and target ICP (vs. the one-size-fits-all summaries and industry reports published by traditional market research firms);</li><li><strong>Streamline high-quality content creation</strong>&nbsp;by working with a "collage" of raw material—including proprietary transcripts & semi-structured contextual information—for rapid drafting of thought leadership content, which you can then subject to critiques by AI personas modeled on your target audience that help you refine ideas through interactive dialogue.</li></ol><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this piece, I'll explore how business leaders can leverage AI to enhance their marketing initiatives, especially regarding rapid market research and high-quality content creation. By harnessing the power of AI, business leaders & marketing professionals can mine deep insights from publicly available sources, craft hyper-targeted content, and ultimately improve their overall marketing strategies.</p>

<h2>AI-Powered Market Research</h2>

<p>Developing a deep understanding of your target audience—including their interests and frustrations, both moving targets in an increasingly dynamic world—is critical for business leaders who want to serve new segments and deepen their relationships with existing customers. Traditionally, customer discovery interviews have been the go-to method for gathering valuable information.</p>

<p>I have&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/d/cst9-jzy-7kj/accelerated-ai-adoption-strategic-planning-call" target="_blank">been doing customer discovery interviews</a>&nbsp;(as a product manager, startup founder, and independent consultant) for nearly a decade; it's an area where almost all businesses chronically underinvest.</p>

<p>However, I also understand why it's not as common of a practice as one might expect: A single cycle of 10, 25, or 50 interviews can cost $10ks of dollars in analyst labor & interviewee compensation (e.g., a $100 Amazon gift card) and take weeks or even months to gather information and collate it into a set of actionable recommendations.</p>

<p>Figuring out exactly which questions to ask and probe into is challenging to know prospectively, especially if the interviewer has little direct experience with the problem space the interviewees operate in. Additionally, the art of asking good questions is hard to teach—simply running a scripted process doesn't work particularly well since the most valuable information usually emerges via a skilled interviewer's adaptive, curious approach.</p>

<p>AI can help streamline and enhance the discovery process by helping you mine precise insights from preexisting interviews done by skilled interviewers with individuals who fit into your target persona, allowing you to quickly gain a contextual understanding of a new market segment and adequately prepare to make a more substantial time & money investment into a cycle of traditional customer discovery interviews or launching a new marketing initiative.</p>

<h2>Transcription and analysis</h2>

<p>Thanks to state-of-the-art AI transcription models like&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/d/cst9-jzy-7kj/accelerated-ai-adoption-strategic-planning-call" target="_blank">Whisper</a>, anyone with a laptop can transcribe and analyze large corpora of text from data-rich sources like podcasts and interviews.</p>

<p>As I've written,&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/d/cst9-jzy-7kj/accelerated-ai-adoption-strategic-planning-call" target="_blank">you can (with a bit of help from GPT-4) transcribe an entire podcast interview backlog</a>&nbsp;of ~100 hours of content nearly for free. A few months ago, transcribing that much content would have cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p>

<h2>Personalized summaries</h2>

<p>Once you've collected this massive amount of raw material, you can (literally) interrogate it with GPT-4. Think of it as an "AI analyst pre-read."</p>

<p>This approach affords you the following:</p><ol><li><strong>A ton of time and money saved</strong>: At $50/hour, simply having an entry-level analyst listen to this backlog would have cost you ~$5,000; per&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/d/cst9-jzy-7kj/accelerated-ai-adoption-strategic-planning-call" target="_blank">OpenAI's pricing</a>, GPT-4 will "read" the same amount of text for ~$50 and in 1 hour. That's a two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in cost and wait time!</li><li><strong>Precise insights</strong>: When you engineer your AI prompts with high precision, you can craft context-aware questions that incorporate your goals and surface the most salient information; you'll be able to "index" the information in the transcripts in a way that best serves&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;ends. Compare this to generic summaries produced by third parties (e.g., traditional market research firms that publish one-size-fits-all industry reports) that prioritize information that may or may not be relevant to your most pressing goals, strategic considerations, and core competencies.</li></ol><p>Now you've extracted exact information about what's important & salient to prospects in a new market segment, you're ready to take action.</p>

<h2>High-Quality Content Creation</h2>

<p>Once you have gathered insights from your market research, you can leverage AI to produce a greater volume of more precise, higher-quality content across two complementary types of activity:</p><ol><li><strong>Targeted outreach</strong>: Take personalization—a tried-and-true marketing technique—to the next level by weaving AI-mined nuggets of info (e.g., unusual turns-of-phrase or esoteric topics used by a particular prospect or industry thought leader in an interview, references to controversial or unresolved issues for a specific community, extremely specific requests for expert input) into concise outreach messages.</li><li><strong>Publication of inbound attractors</strong>: Develop digital assets that demonstrate credibility, thought leadership, and differentiated value by leveraging your team's unique perspectives and strengths to contribute to the conversations that your prospects are most interested in.</li></ol><h2>Collecting additional raw material</h2>

<p>Once you've gathered insights from your AI-enhanced market research, you can use that information to "prompt" more raw material from yourself and your team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can do this in three ways:</p><ol><li><strong>Record a morning monologue</strong>&nbsp;about the salient topics you're best equipped to address (I recommend using&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/d/cst9-jzy-7kj/accelerated-ai-adoption-strategic-planning-call" target="_blank">Scribe</a>&nbsp;and going for a walk after your first cup of coffee!).</li><li><strong>Record a long-form podcast-style discussion</strong>&nbsp;between yourself and one or more team members (or someone outside of your organization) who can bring their expertise and diverse perspectives to a meaty conversation about the salient topic(s). If you work with someone outside of your organization, you may also become a more central node in your target network (via the effect of explicit co-authorship and how recommender platforms index information).</li><li><strong>Record a session with a client</strong>&nbsp;where you apply the hypotheses or new mental models generated through the ideation process in steps 1 & 2 to real-world value creation; if your customers are happy with the result, then it means that you're really onto something, and you can use this recording to create derivative content that's not just interesting but also demonstrates credibility (e.g., de-identified anecdotes about how a customer benefited from your unique approach to this salient problem).</li></ol><h2>Drafting with a "context collage"</h2>

<p>By combining raw material (e.g., transcripts) with other contextual information (e.g., what you're hoping to achieve with a given content piece, who it's for, the medium), AI can synthesize a pretty darn good first draft, whether it's for a cold email, LinkedIn post, long-form essay, or YouTube video script.</p>

<p>It's important to note that this is quite different than the traditional linear writing process, whereby you're spending a lot of time and energy typing to encode ideas into a word processor. "Writing" (and other types of content creation) with AI is akin to&nbsp;<em>creating a collage</em>, with AI pulling together various components to produce a cohesive piece of content.</p>

<p>In practice, this could mean copying and pasting parts of your transcript, information from the market research report about what your target audience cares about, and adding a bit of color into a ChatGPT prompt and then hitting "enter."</p>

<p>You then iterate through dialogue with the machine until it starts to "feel" right. Rapidly combine core ingredients (and "taste-test" periodically); speed is the name of the game.</p>

<h2>Editing and reflecting</h2>

<p>After generating your first few drafts, it's time to reflect with AI assistance. By asking AI to adopt specific personas (e.g., a highly skeptical reader, a known expert in the space, a digital profile of a given prospect given their LinkedIn profile, copied-and-pasted into the ChatGPT window) and critique your content, you can further refine your ideas, address possible objections, and ensure your core messaging effectively resonates with your target audience.</p>

<p>Before you know it, you're ready to hit "post," "publish," or "send" —&nbsp;and you might almost immediately discover how well this approach works. By handling lower-level cognitive tasks (e.g., pressing keys, scanning huge bodies of text), AI frees us all up to think more deeply about important issues; by going the extra mile for customers by investing your precious attention into consideration of the topics they care about on their behalf, thereby creating real value and adding a personalized touch to your digital communications, you stand to benefit from a significant increase in conversion rates, deeper relationships with customers, and accelerated progress toward your company's strategic goals.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>To summarize, with AI-powered market research and high-quality content creation processes in place, businesses can:</p><ol><li>Rapidly gain a deep understanding of their target customers;</li><li>Increase response rates with relevant messaging; and</li><li>Attract organic attention with content that provides a unique, substantial, and objectively interesting perspective on salient topics.</li></ol><p>While "eternal marketing truths" haven't changed, you can now explore, discover, and create with AI faster and at a lower cost than ever before.</p>
