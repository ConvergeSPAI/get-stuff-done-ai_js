 <p><a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">Deep Work</a>&nbsp;has become a bit of a meme. While many executives and other knowledge workers are familiar with the term—and perhaps the praxis of deep work—few have incorporated it into their routines. Given the evidence for deep work’s goodness, the widespread availability of deep work “how-to’s,” the lip service paid to it by managers, and the fact that the digital age makes this more feasible than ever, the fact that it remains a rare phenomenon in the wild is rather odd.</p>

<p>What explains this?</p>

<p>I have sometimes found that when I present deep work as a concept to clients, friends, and colleagues, they generally like the sound of it. But when they realize the changes in their habits and routines it would necessitate, they begin to find the concept impractical (or even offensive).</p>

<p>Some common objections:</p><ol><li><strong>“It’s not for me.”</strong>&nbsp;That’s true as long as you believe it.</li><li><strong>“There’s no way I could make four hours of uninterrupted deep work time in a single day, let alone four days a week. I have to be online available and urgently responding to incoming requests.”</strong>&nbsp;Unless you’re a salesperson or customer service representative, this is likely a self-imposed limiting belief&nbsp;<a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/larping-your-job" target="_blank">reinforced by video games masquerading as corporate communication software</a>. Even if you are a customer service representative or a salesperson, you should still be able to make deep work&nbsp;<em>work</em>&nbsp;because you will inevitably discover value-adding tasks that you can document and routinize.</li><li><strong>We are currently in crisis mode, i.e., “wartime.”</strong></li><li><strong>“I don’t even know what I should be doing during deep work time.”</strong></li></ol><p>Objections three and four are the subject of this essay.</p>

<p>The truth is that 3–4x 4-hour deep work chunks per week are the platonic ideal for digital market economy participants who care to thrive in the 21st century. During deep work time, you’re essentially investing in human capital–intensive assets and “developing bespoke technology” (this includes process design and does not need to be codified in machine language for it to be valuable). Asset (technology) development is the only moral way to create compounding value (which can accrue to you as a sole proprietor or the collective corporate entity to which you belong) and thus wealth. I am not aware of any alternatives.</p>

<p>However, at a given time, whether you’re able to do deep work at all and the types of problems you should focus on are a function of your current environment. Particular limiting factors, which you can remove, are related to objections 3 and 4 above.</p>

<p>To understand “where you are” (and thus what you can do about it), ask yourself the following questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Am I in wartime or peacetime?</strong></li><li>Do I know what I need to do, or <strong>have I wandered into a dark spot on the map?</strong></li></ol><h2>“We are in crisis mode…”</h2>

<p>If it’s wartime, you must first “stop the bleeding”; then return to peacetime ASAP. Do this by putting structure around your work as quickly as possible. Tighten feedback loops between teammates. Introduce a sense of urgency into everything you do, especially the content and quality of your communication.</p>

<p>For example, if there’s a system outage or one of your suppliers suddenly and unexpectedly went under, you need first to figure out how to fix the issues at hand. Spending four hours doing deep work would be irresponsible—<strong>you need to survive</strong>&nbsp;and then keep digging until you get to the root of the problem. That second part is critical if you want to return to and stay in peacetime. If, say, a recent update introduced a critical bug to your codebase, then, of course, the first thing you want to do is roll back the system to a previous version. But, you should also dedicate sufficient resources to understanding the root cause of the problem in the first place—not just in terms of code but also (and perhaps more importantly) regarding human errors and process failures. Once you’ve fixed those systemic and organizational issues, you’ll have a more durable foundation. On the other hand, if you don’t identify and address the underlying issues, you are almost guaranteed to find yourself in wartime again soon, or, worst case, your successors will suffer some catastrophic meltdown in the distant future.</p>

<p>If it’s peacetime and you have the privilege and luxury of doing deep work up to four days per week, then you should protect that time and attention as much as possible and set yourself up for success. This is a pretty straightforward exercise: Figure out the 3 to 4 most excruciatingly difficult problems you need to solve or think you need to solve to make outsized progress towards your longer-term goals. Scope them to fit into four-hour chunks, come up with definitions of done, and then allocate them to days of the week. When you know what you need to work on daily, you should feel confident in your decision to hermetically seal your attention from any irrelevant interface with the digital world and focus on solving a local problem. If you don’t plan your mornings, you’ll always be left with doubt that you’re not working on the right thing, and you will likely become distracted during your deep work time.</p>

<p>To maximize quality-of-attention during those hours, it is imperative that you get 7 to 9 hours of sleep the night before and not<em>&nbsp;commit the grave error&nbsp;</em>of checking email, Slack, or any other messaging service between the time you wake up and when you start your deep work. The goal is to be unreachable until ~1 pm on deep work days.</p>

<h2>“I don’t even know what I should be doing…”</h2>

<p>This could be true for a few different reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Unclear strategic direction.</strong>&nbsp;If the company mission, vision, and medium-term strategic direction are unclear, you may want to consider joining a different company. If the purpose-driven direction of your deep work is out of alignment with that of the company, then the effect of your labor will be blunted. If you’re not an executive, your options are to support execs in setting strategic direction, find a company that is in a state of clarity and alignment, or stake out on your own as an entrepreneur. The last path is probably the most difficult, but it does allow you to achieve the highest degree of alignment (and, thus, do the deepest deep work).</li><li><strong>The team’s objective is clear, but&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;to accomplish that objective is unclear.</strong>&nbsp;Deep work is a great way to get yourself out of this conundrum; however, instead of developing hardened technology towards a particular end (e.g., writing code), you should spend your deep work time designing and running experiments. For example, if you’re having issues generating demand, you might want to figure out novel ways to reach your prospects with new content and channels. As a general rule, the ideal deep work problem is one that no one has ever solved; short of that lofty ideal, it should at least be a problem you have never solved.</li><li><strong>You’re making significant progress, and you’ve found yourself in the enviable position of having a genuine surplus of time and attention.</strong>&nbsp;This is deep work time you should spend on research and development. Google’s famous 20% rule is a good benchmark for how much you should invest (note that that’s roughly equivalent to one day per 5-day work week). If you’ve wandered into the frontier of human knowledge, and what lies ahead of you is a dark spot on the map, this is an excellent opportunity to engage in undirected discovery and exploration. There is a fantastic book by Kenneth Stanley called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective/dp/3319155237" target="_blank">The Myth of the Objective</a>&nbsp;where he explains, through findings in machine learning research, that value on the frontier can be ascertained through a process of undirected discovery, driven by curiosity and a will-to-interestingness (in stark contrast to goal-driven progress). Instead of doing something in the context of a narrow and precise objective, you’re simply allowing yourself to become deeply curious and pursue ideas that are inexplicably interesting to you. In practice, perhaps on a Friday from 9 am to 1 pm, you read everything you possibly can about a topic related to your vocation that you’ve been curious about but haven’t had the time to explore. Or, you could pick up a new tool for the first time and get your first reps in. (If you’re a designer, for example, you might use this time to learn the nuances of a tool like&nbsp;<a href="http://midjourney.com/" target="_blank">Midjourney</a>* or DALLE-2 to create AI-generated concept art.)</li></ol><p>Establishing clear strategic direction, running experiments in a complex environment where the link between cause-and-effect is still tenuous, and undirected exploration are all valuable activities that fit into 4-hour “discovery” deep work chunks. Post-discovery, it becomes easier to scope deep work and pursue more precise goals.</p>

<h2>OK, but why should I do this at all?</h2>

<p>One of the best parts of incorporating deep work into your weekly routine is that it frees up a shocking amount of time and attention—attention that you can allocate towards meaningful non-work activities, say, in service to your family and community.</p>
