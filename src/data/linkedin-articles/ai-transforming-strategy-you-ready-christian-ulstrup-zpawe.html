 <p>I recently geeked out with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/montgomerydan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAIn-YBNrCiLZjtuSpVDCC2RndguMGebfI">Daniel Montgomery</a> on his Agile Strategies podcast about the surprising ways AI is already affecting strategy —&nbsp;and how it will only accelerate.</p><hr><p>Some key takeaways:</p>

<p><strong>AI enables <em>information liquidity</em>:</strong> Strategists can now access, analyze and act on qualitative data at unprecedented speed and scale. Customer interviews, research findings, meeting notes — AI helps compress these rich information sources into their actionable essence.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on the frontier:</strong> AI's data crunching power frees up human attention for what matters most — grappling with anomalies and exploring the unknown unknowns at the edge of imagination. The best strategies emerge from this creative frontier.</p>

<p><strong>Probe, learn, repeat:</strong> In an uncertain world, static plans are brittle. AI supercharges the process of probing reality, rapidly assimilating feedback, and iterating. Strategists can experiment more boldly, learn faster, and adapt with agility.</p>

<p><strong>Augment, don't automate:</strong> AI shines at filtering information and generating options. But humans remain uniquely capable of the judgment, empathy and creativity needed for great strategy. The winning combo is AI and human intelligence working in tandem.</p><hr><p>Some questions to ponder:</p>

<p>- How much time does your team spend on rote information processing vs. creative strategy? </p>

<p>- What experiments could you run if you had 10X more info at your fingertips?</p>

<p>- Where is your organization's strategic frontier — and how will you explore it?</p>

<p><em>One thing is clear</em>: AI is already a game-changer for strategy. Leaders ignore it at their peril.</p><hr><p>Eager to dive deeper? </p>
