 <p>I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_ok-so-my-first-24h-review-of-cognition-activity-7275193108420608002-nBQT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">continue to be impressed</a> by <a target="_blank">Cognition</a>'s Devin, the first legitimately ~autonomous "AI software engineer": It's forcing me to level up (IC to manager mindset/skillset when it comes to product development for my <a href="https://powerline.bot" target="_blank">AI Chief-of-Staff product</a> [now used by 9 CEOs across the US!], which I've been mostly brute forcing with verbal direction + o1-preview and now o1 Pro), which is a nice bonus, beyond the core benefit of getting time back.</p>

<p>I'm not alone in this assessment; there are even <a href="https://x.com/AymanSa72166849/status/1869312006043705740" target="_blank">reports of teams</a> pulling software engineering job listings after just one week of use:</p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQHb34DhSucfGw" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHb34DhSucfGw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1734704892313?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=sEji0NdZRCUnxlOZizrZcLC_591tkiMRx568eh1bocU"><figcaption>https://x.com/AymanSa72166849/status/1869140429834477853</figcaption></figure><p>It's also spurred a few ideas about where things could/might/should go if we extend the general "agent" approach (if you want to go deeper, I'd highly recommend <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents" target="_blank">this salient article </a>from the team at <a target="_blank">Anthropic</a>), spurred by the following question that's implicitly raised by these early signs of life from D., o1, et cetera:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>What are <strong>types of work</strong> (and maybe, more specifically, <em>precise slices</em> of soon-to-be-vestigial knowledge work roles) where:</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>the agent can be narrowly-enough spec'd in re it's <strong>general goal and specialized toolset</strong>, such that </p></li><li><p>simply <strong>cranking up compute spend</strong> would </p></li><li><p>yield a result that is at least <strong>50% as good at 1/10 the cost</strong> of the human labor substitute, and perhaps </p></li><li><blockquote><p>unlocks previously inaccessible value </p></blockquote></li><li><p>due to the<strong> enlarged scope of the information space</strong> that can be searched and mined due to </p></li><li><p>the lower cost and <strong>~10x faster computation</strong>?</p></blockquote></li></ul><p>In general, I think the answer is "research"; there are narrow problem spaces where one could build a profitable, tailored research assistant product that is:</p><ol><li><p>more bespoke than, e.g., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-nears-launch-of-ai-agents-to-automate-tasks-for-users" target="_blank">Operator</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-mariner/" target="_blank">Mariner</a>, and whatever Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use" target="_blank">releases</a>;</p></li><li><p>has access to semi-proprietary data sources—or, even better, an expanding "<a href="https://x.com/curious_vii/status/1823899802309906540" target="_blank">data commons</a>"; and</p></li><li><p>commands a nice premium over traditional SaaS seat-based licenses by trading a massive reduction in marginal clicks for high-3-to-even-4-figures of revenue per month (particularly relevant: the perennial <a target="_blank">Stratechery</a> insight in re the relative impossibility of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2010/apple-innovators-dilemma/?t" target="_blank">"overshooting" good UX</a>).</p></li></ol><p>Three possible instantiations of the above (yes, this is an explicit invitation to build these—I would pay a premium for all three!):</p><ol><li><p>a "<strong>business developer</strong>" that facilitates fruitful connections via deep, deep research prior to bidding for the principal's limited attention (related: one of the main bottlenecks going forward will be human attention, i.e., the rate of improvement of context window length is surely greater than our own, or <em>we're all executives now</em>); an MVP of this might be a <strong>matchmaking system</strong> that facilitates the fewest, most surprising connections between conference attendees prior to the event given some publicly available information about the ticketholders and a modicum of information in re their goals, what's salient, etc., all of which can be elicited during a short phone conversation via a voice assistant like <a target="_blank">Vapi</a>;</p></li><li><p>a "<strong>recruiter</strong>" that does search across not-only-human candidates and even breaks the FTE/contractor models by default: Given some rich data (again, let's say, meeting or call transcripts), this flavor of agentic system should be able to d<strong>erive the no. 1 problem their principal faces</strong> (I can tell you from experience, by the way, that this is often latent in the unstructured source material, not apparent those who face the problem, but <strong>legible to state-of-the-art foundation models</strong>), performs a massively broad search across specialist software solutions (which could be products for people or <strong>tools for agents</strong> with deeper access to their principal's secrets), hyper-differentiated individual SMEs (i.e., AI-powered services solopreneurs, which is already emerging labor category...I know this, in part, <em>because I am one</em>) who are open to outcome-based compensation, and then, on the margin, your more traditional specialist shops/agencies or—GASP—a part- or full-time hire; and</p></li><li><p>an "<strong>aligned curator</strong>" that produces some kind of <strong>anti-mimetic content feed</strong>: Instead of hoovering up attention by prioritizing <em>socially proven</em> content that hooks directly into our lizard brains à la the web2 behemoths, what if your open-ended discovery agent (see also: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective/dp/3319155237" target="_blank">Ken Stanley's work</a>) could go deeper and deeper into an untrodden pocket of latent space, generating hypotheses and even counterintuitive insights for you to meditate on, say, a weekly basis? I'm talking <em>actual personalization</em> (in the sense of personalism and <a href="https://primematters.com/foundations/search-truth/studiositas-and-curiositas" target="_blank"><em>studiositas</em></a> vs. the potent combination of pride/envy/curiositas that drives so much digital media consumption at the moment).</p></li></ol><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/perplexity-ai/">Perplexity</a>, Google's new Gemini <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/" target="_blank">Deep Research</a> product, and o1 with <a href="https://openai.com/index/o1-and-new-tools-for-developers/" target="_blank">tools and variable TTC</a> are great first steps.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing how entrepreneurs, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianulstrup_if-theres-one-thing-you-commit-to-in-2025-activity-7274438151656411136-9kNH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank"><strong>including and especially YOU!</strong></a>, take the aforementioned capabilities to the next level in '25—and reporting back on what I learn as I integrate these nascent, next-gen AI capabilities deeper into my and my clients' workflows, all the way from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerated-ai-adoption-christian-ulstrup-9wgke/" target="_blank">single-player to multiplayer modes</a>.</p>
