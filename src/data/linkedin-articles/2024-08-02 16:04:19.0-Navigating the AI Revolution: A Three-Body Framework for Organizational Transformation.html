 <p>As artificial intelligence begins to reshape institutions, leaders face a critical challenge: How should they proactively redesign roles and team structures in an "AI-native" way that is more "evolution" than "revolution"?</p><hr><p>Having worked with clients on this very issue, I've developed a framework that views this challenge as a "three-body problem" — a complex system where three interdependent factors must be considered (and reconsidered) relationally:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Strategic Direction</strong>: Where does your organization want to go?</p></li><li><p><strong>AI Capabilities</strong>: What new possibilities does AI unlock <em>specific to your internal / external context</em>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Organizational Structure</strong>: How should roles and teams be reconfigured?</p></li></ol><p>Let's dive into each of these components and explore practical steps leaders can take to get ahead of the curve.</p><hr><p><strong>Body 1: Clarifying Strategic Direction</strong></p>

<p>Before making a public commitment plugging AI into anything and everything, it's helpful to get clear on your organization's fundamental purpose. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p>Who do we serve? </p></li><li><p>What problem do we solve for them, and why do they choose us in particular?</p></li><li><p>How could we serve them even better in the future?</p></li></ul><p>This customer-centric approach to mission and vision provides a north star for all subsequent decisions. It's independent of AI (and, best case, the answers are already somewhat self-evident), but will be critical in guiding how you leverage new technological capabilities.</p><hr><p><strong>Body 2: Exploring AI Capabilities</strong></p>

<p>The scope of what can be computed is expanding rapidly. AI is becoming the "Excel for words"—and soon, for images, audio, and more exotic data types. To understand what this means for your organization:</p><ol><li><p>Provide access to general-purpose AI tools (e.g., <a target="_blank">OpenAI</a>'s ChatGPT Enterprise; <a target="_blank">Anthropic</a>'s analogous capabilities, available via cloud platforms like AWS Bedrock; transcription tools like <a target="_blank">superwhisper</a>; AI meeting notetakers like <a target="_blank">Fireflies.ai</a>; asynchronous communication tools like <a target="_blank">Loom</a> x Slack)</p></li><li><p>Explicitly encourage experimentation and tinkering</p></li><li><p>Create channels for sharing learnings (e.g. Slack channels, office hours)</p></li></ol><p>A small percentage of your team will dive in eagerly. These "AI pioneers" will uncover new possibilities aligned with your mission. Their experiments will generate valuable, reality-grounded data on what AI can actually do in your specific context.</p><hr><p><strong>Body 3: Redesigning Organizational Structure</strong></p>

<p>As AI capabilities become clearer, you'll need to rethink how work is structured. This involves:</p><ol><li><p>Mapping current information and value flows</p></li><li><p>Identifying roles heavy on reading/writing tasks (likely to change significantly)</p></li><li><p>Observing how AI pioneers are "unbundling" and "rebundling" their tasks</p></li><li><p>Formalizing new AI-native job archetypes</p></li></ol><p>Be prepared for significant changes. Some roles may become obsolete, while others expand. New positions may emerge. Even C-suite titles might need rethinking.</p><hr><p><strong>Putting It All Together: The Transformation Process</strong></p><ol><li><p>Clarify strategic direction</p></li><li><p>Provide AI tools and encourage experimentation ("user-led innovation")</p></li><li><p>Set ambitious goals aligned with your mission</p></li><li><p>Create enough space via (3) between <em>where you are</em> and <em>where you should go</em> that you can offer open invitations for people to prudently "hire AI" for certain tasks and then step into new roles</p></li><li><p>Identify necessary structural changes</p></li><li><p>Execute changes decisively, while mitigating operational risks</p></li></ol><p>This process reveals pre-existing fit issues and creates space for people to find their new niche. Some may need to retool within the organization, while others may not fit the new paradigm.</p>

<p><strong>A Word of Caution</strong></p>

<p>Many organizations have overhired or accumulated roles that are no longer critical. The AI revolution may necessitate significant downsizing for some. If this becomes clear, it's often better to make cuts swiftly and cleanly, rather than creating prolonged uncertainty.</p>

<p>Before any major restructuring, ensure you have a clear picture of how value flows through your organization to mitigate catastrophic risks.</p>

<p>The Road Ahead</p>

<p>The AI transformation journey is complex and unique for each organization. By viewing it through this three-body framework, leaders can navigate the process more effectively, balancing strategic vision, technological possibilities, and organizational realities.</p>

<p>Remember, the goal isn't just to adopt AI – it's to leverage AI in service of your mission, creating more value for those you serve. Organizations that master this balancing act will be well-positioned to thrive in the AI-driven future.</p>
