(And why?) [<em>final cause</em>]</p></li><li><p><strong>AI Capabilities</strong>: What new paths, processes, and possibilities does AI unlock <em>specific to your internal / external context</em>? [<em>material cause</em>]</p></li><li><p><strong>Organizational Structure</strong>: How should roles and teams be reconfigured in light of (1) & (2)? [<em>formal cause</em>]</p></li></ol><p>Let's explore how leaders can bring these "bodies" into focus and take practical steps to get ahead of the curve(s).</p><hr><p><strong>Body 1: Strategic Direction</strong></p>

<p>Before making a public commitment plugging AI into anything and everything, it's good to get clear—and make a public declaration accordingly—on your organization's fundamental purpose.</p>

<p>Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p><em>Whom</em> do we serve?</p></li><li><p><em>What problem</em> do we solve for him or her, and <em>why</em> <em>does he or she choose us</em> <em>in particular</em>?</p></li><li><p>How could we serve clients/customers <em>10x better</em>?</p></li></ul><p>Your north star, composed of durable answers to the three questions above, exists independently of "AI" (and, best case, the answers are already somewhat self-evident); it is a source of confidence throughout the transformation process and the transcendent object upon which you'll tether your team's efforts, resilient regardless of what you encounter.</p><hr><p><strong>Body 2: Capabilities</strong></p>

<p>The scope of what can be computed is expanding, rapidly. </p>

<p>An LLM-powered application like ChatGPT is perhaps best thought of as an "Excel for words"—and soon, for "images, audio, and more exotic data."</p>

<p>To understand what this means for your organization, cut through hype, eschew "storytelling," and instead prioritize the creation of <em>compelling facts</em> by:</p><ol><li><p>Providing employees access to general-purpose AI tools (e.g., <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>'s ChatGPT Enterprise; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropicresearch/" target="_blank">Anthropic</a>'s analogous capabilities, available via cloud platforms like AWS Bedrock; SOTA transcription tools like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/superwhisper/" target="_blank">superwhisper</a>; AI meeting notetakers like <a href="http://Fireflies.ai" target="_blank">Fireflies.ai</a>; asynchronous communication tools like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/useloom/" target="_blank">Loom</a> x Slack),</p></li><li><p>Explicitly encouraging tinkering (and handsomely rewarding individuals who share the fruits of their experiments publicly), and</p></li><li><p>Creating new "digital watering holes" (e.g. Slack channels, office hours), Schelling points for public discourse, where new latent know-how can be passively captured.</p></li></ol><p>A small percentage of your team will dive in (expect 1–3% of all employees to pick up the tools and <em>sprint</em> —&nbsp;These "AI pioneers" (or <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/detecting-the-secret-cyborgs" target="_blank">secret cyborgs</a> granted amnesty) will uncover new possibilities aligned with your mission, well worth the cost of the other 97% of the monthly licenses.</p>

<p>Their experiments will generate invaluable, reality-grounded data (which, when you look closely at it, exist in sharp contrast to the glut of pre-experimental speculation eating up so much attention at the moment) that illustrate what AI—and generative AI, specifically in 2024—<em>can actually do</em> in/for your business and customers.</p><hr><p><strong>Body 3: Reformation</strong></p>

<p>As capabilities (and, at least as importantly, the surprising ways in which the technology <em>doesn't</em> work) become clear, you'll have no choice but to rethink how work is structured.</p>

<p>Encode this knowledge by:</p><ol><li><p>Mapping current information and value flows between your business and its various customers, partners, and competitors (and then internally between the constituent individuals and functional teams),</p></li><li><p>Identifying roles heavy on reading/writing tasks (these are likely to change significantly),</p></li><li><p>Observing how AI pioneers are "unbundling" and "re-bundling" tasks into new jobs; take note of the emerging "shape" of these AI-native roles, and</p></li><li><p>Formalizing new AI-native job archetypes.</p></li></ol><p>Be prepared for significant changes. Some roles may become obsolete, while others expand.</p>

<p>New positions may emerge. Even C-suite titles deserve scrutiny.</p><hr><p><strong>Putting It All Together: The Transformation Process</strong></p><ol><li><p>Clarify strategic direction.</p></li><li><p>Provide AI tools and encourage experimentation ("user-led innovation").</p></li><li><p>Set ambitious goals aligned with your mission; apply nigh-ascetic constraints.</p></li><li><p>Create enough space via (3) between <em>where you are</em> and <em>where you should go</em> that you can offer open invitations for people to prudently "hire AI" for certain tasks and then step into new roles.</p></li><li><p>Identify necessary structural changes through careful analysis of proprietary data.</p></li><li><p>When the time's right, execute one-way door changes (e.g., re-orgs) <em>decisively</em>, having already carefully mitigated risks that might disrupt the flow of woking capital.</p></li></ol><hr><p><strong>A Word of Caution</strong></p>

<p>This "3 body" approach tends to reveal pre-existing fit issues and creates space for people to find their new niche.</p>

<p>Some may need to retool within the organization, while others may not fit the new paradigm.</p>

<p>In re the "fit" issue, the truth is that some organizations have over-hired (pre-AI) or accumulated roles that served an important purpose in the context of scaling 20th-century bureaucracies, but—in light of the IT revolution in general—are no longer as critical.</p>

<p>A true AI-native transformation may necessitate significant downsizing for some organizations; it may also lead to massive "upsizing" for others.</p>

<p>If it becomes clear that you're in the former situation, it's better to make changes swiftly and cleanly, rather than creating prolonged uncertainty, which can lead to flight by top talent.</p>

<p>Before any major restructuring, ensure you have a clear picture of how value flows through your organization to mitigate <em>catastrophic risks</em>; you don't want to accidentally pull the wrong Jenga block.</p><hr><p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>

<p>Armed with this three-body framework, leaders can navigate the process of AI transformation more effectively, balancing strategic vision, particular technological possibilities, and (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/moving-past-gen-ais-honeymoon-phase-seven-hard-truths-for-cios-to-get-from-pilot-to-scale." target="_blank">per salient data</a> from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mckinsey/" target="_blank">McKinsey & Company</a>, perhaps unprecedented) levels of change management.</p>

<p>Remember, the goal isn't just to integrate AI into your existing processes—it's to use these new capabilities in <em>service of your mission</em>, creating more substantially more value for those you serve.</p>

<p>Organizations that master this balancing act will be well-positioned to thrive in the 21st-century.</p>
