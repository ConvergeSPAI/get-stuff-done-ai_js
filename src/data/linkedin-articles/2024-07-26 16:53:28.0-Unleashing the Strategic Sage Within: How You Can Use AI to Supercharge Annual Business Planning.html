 <p>As artificial intelligence continues to advance at a rapid pace, forward-thinking companies are exploring ways to leverage AI to gain a competitive edge. </p>

<p>One compelling application is using AI to enhance the strategic planning process.</p>

<p>By intelligently collecting richer data and rapidly synthesizing insights, AI can help organizations make higher quality strategic decisions.</p><hr><p><strong>The Importance of Ground Truth</strong></p>

<p>At its core, effective strategic planning relies on having an accurate understanding of ground truth â€”what is really happening in your business right now, both internally and externally. </p>

<p>Traditionally, this has involved manually gathering data from disparate systems like financials, CRM, product analytics, and HR databases. Some companies also conduct internal surveys to capture employee perspectives. </p>

<p>However, these approaches often fall short in terms of the richness, freshness, and speed of the insights generated. Important knowledge remains <em>locked in people's heads</em>, data quickly becomes stale, and it can take weeks of analysis to unearth key takeaways. </p>

<p>As a result, strategic decisions are made based on an incomplete or outdated picture.</p>

<p><strong>AI-Powered Data Collection</strong></p>

<p>This is where AI can be a game-changer. </p>

<p>Using tools like AI-enhanced surveys (see: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/voiceform/">Voiceform</a>), and automated phone interviews (e.g., via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/vapi-ai/">Vapi</a>), companies can now collect significantly richer data from employees, especially customer-facing staff who have valuable frontline insights not captured in systems. </p>

<p>For example, after receiving an email invitation to give an AI-powered phone line a call (at his or her convenience), a sales rep could verbally share observations from recent client meetings, which get automatically transcribed and analyzed for sentiment and themes. Product usage logs, e.g., from @mixpanel can be intelligently clustered to identify power users and key behaviors. Employee responses to open-ended survey questions can be semantically parsed to surface frequently mentioned issues and opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Rapid Insight Synthesis</strong></p>

<p>The second way AI enhances strategic planning is by compressing the time needed to extract insights from raw data. With techniques like unsupervised learning, topic modeling, and summarization, AI engines can rapidly identify patterns and distill key takeaways from large, unstructured datasets.</p>

<p>Short of that, you can just stuff the transcripts into a new chat with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropicresearch/">Anthropic</a> </p>

<p>Instead of an analyst spending days manually tagging and graphing survey responses, an AI system could automatically create a concise executive summary within minutes. Execs could even use conversational AI to interactively explore the data, drilling down into items of interest. This allows decision-makers to incorporate much fresher, more comprehensive insights into strategic plans.</p>

<p><strong>Piloting the Approach</strong></p>

<p>For companies interested in piloting an AI-enhanced strategic planning process, a reasonable timeline would be:</p>

<p>- Month 1: Assess current planning practices, map key decisions, and identify insight gaps </p>

<p>- Month 2: Design and implement AI-powered data collection mechanisms (surveys, interviews, etc)</p>

<p>- Month 3: Conduct data collection in the lead up to quarterly/annual planning</p>

<p>- Month 4: Use AI to synthesize insights and hold enhanced strategy sessions</p>

<p>- Month 5+: Measure improvements in strategic plan quality, alignment and execution</p>

<p>As with any new business process, it's important to start small, move quickly, and iterate based on feedback. But the potential upside is significant - richer insights driving clearer priorities and better decisions. That's an edge that every exec should be eager to harness.</p>

<p>The rise of AI is creating compelling new opportunities to reimagine core business activities. Strategic planning is ripe for disruption. Forward-leaning companies would be wise to explore how AI can help them chart a clearer course in an increasingly dynamic and competitive landscape.</p>
