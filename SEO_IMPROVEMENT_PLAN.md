# SEO Improvement Plan for GSD at Work

## Current Issues

1. **Brand Visibility**: Site doesn't appear when searching "gsd at work"
2. **Title Tags**: Don't include brand name prominently
3. **Meta Descriptions**: Missing brand mentions
4. **Domain Authority**: gsdat.work is less intuitive than getstuffdone.ai

## Immediate Actions (Phase 1)

### 1. Update Title Tags to Include Brand

Current: `AI Implementation Services | Expert AI Consulting & Business Automation`
Proposed: `GSD at Work - AI Implementation Services & Business Automation Consulting`

Pattern for all pages:
- Homepage: `GSD at Work - AI Implementation Services & Business Automation Consulting`
- Service pages: `[Service Name] | GSD at Work - Get Stuff Done with AI`
- Blog posts: `[Post Title] | GSD at Work Blog`

### 2. Update Meta Descriptions

Include "GSD at Work" in the first 60 characters of all meta descriptions.

Example:
```
GSD at Work helps organizations implement AI to get stuff done 10x faster. Expert consulting, hands-on workshops, and proven automation strategies.
```

### 3. Add Brand Schema Markup

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "GSD at Work",
  "alternateName": ["Get Stuff Done at Work", "GSD at Work LLC"],
  "url": "https://gsdat.work",
  "logo": "https://gsdat.work/logo.png",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.linkedin.com/company/gsd-at-work-llc/",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianulstrup/"
  ]
}
```

### 4. Create Brand-Focused H1

Current H1 likely focuses on services. Add brand context:
- Before: "Transform Your Business with AI"
- After: "GSD at Work: Transform Your Business with AI Implementation"

## Medium-Term Actions (Phase 2)

### 5. Build Brand Signals

- Create an About page focusing on "GSD at Work" as a brand
- Add "GSD at Work" to footer on every page
- Use consistent brand mentions in content (3-5 times per page naturally)

### 6. Local SEO Optimization

Since you're a consultancy:
```json
{
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "GSD at Work LLC",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Your City",
    "addressRegion": "Your State"
  }
}
```

### 7. Internal Linking with Brand Anchors

Create internal links using variations:
- "GSD at Work's AI consulting services"
- "Get Stuff Done at Work methodology"
- "GSD at Work team"

## Long-Term Actions (Phase 3)

### 8. Domain Strategy

Consider:
- Redirecting getstuffdone.ai to gsdat.work (or vice versa)
- Using getstuffdone.ai as the primary domain (more memorable)
- Setting up proper 301 redirects to consolidate domain authority

### 9. Brand Building Content

Create content specifically about:
- "What is GSD at Work?"
- "The GSD Methodology"
- "Why GSD at Work"
- Company story/history page

### 10. Google My Business
